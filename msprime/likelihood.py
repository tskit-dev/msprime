def log_mutation_likelihood(ts, mutation_rate):
    """
    Returns the unnormalised log probability of the stored pattern of mutations
    on the stored tree sequence, assuming infinite sites mutation. In particular,
    each stored site must only contain a single mutation, and all mutant alleles
    are treated interchangeably as having arisen from a single mutation rate.
    This is automatically true for some msprime mutation models, such as JC69.
    The omitted normalising constant depends on the pattern of mutations, but not
    on the tree sequence or the mutation rate.

    .. warning::
        The infinite sites assumption means that this method is only valid for
        continuous genomes. It can also be run on discrete genomes, for which it
        may provide a reasonable approximation when the number of sites is large
        and the mutation rate is low. See :ref:`sec_ancestry_discrete_genome`
        for how continuous genomes can be specified when simulating tree sequences
        using msprime.

    The function first computes the probability of the overall number of mutations
    :math:`M` from the Poisson probability mass function

    .. math::
        e^{-T \\mu / 2} \\frac{(T \\mu / 2)^M}{M!},

    where :math:`T` is the total area of ancestral material in the tree sequence
    stored in units of generations, and :math:`\\mu` is the per-site, per-generation
    mutation probability. Each mutation then contributes an individual factor of
    :math:`l / T`, where :math:`l` is the total branch length on which the mutation
    could have arisen while appearing on all of the required lineages, again stored
    in generations.

    .. warning::
        If a tree at the site of a mutation contains unary nodes, then :math:`l` could
        span more than one edge. In particular, we do not constrain mutations to take
        place on the edge directly above the node on which they have been recorded,
        but rather on any edge which would yield the same configuration of SNPs at the
        leaves of the tree sequence.

    :param tskit.TreeSequence ts: The tree sequence object with mutations.
    :param float mutation_rate: The per-site, per-generation mutation probablity.
        Must be non-negative.
    :return: The unnormalised log probability of the observed SNPs given the tree
        sequence. If the mutation rate is set to zero and the tree sequence contains
        at least one mutation, then returns `-float("inf")`.
