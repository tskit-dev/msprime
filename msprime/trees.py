    Loads a tree sequence from the specified file paths. The files input here
    are in a simple whitespace delimited tabular format such as output by the
    :meth:`.TreeSequence.write_records` and
    :meth:`.TreeSequence.write_mutations` methods. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into msprime; the HDF5
    based file format using by :meth:`msprime.load` will be many times more
    efficient that using the text based formats.

    The ``records_file`` must be a text file with six whitespace delimited
    columns. Each line in the file must contain at least this many columns, and
    each line will be stored as a single coalescence record. The columns
    correspond to the ``left``, ``right``, ``node``, ``children``, ``time`` and
    ``population`` fields as described in the :meth:`.TreeSequence.records`
    method. The ``left``, ``right`` and ``time`` fields are parsed as base 10
    floating point values, and the ``node`` and ``population`` fields are
    parsed as base 10 integers. The ``children`` field is a comma-separated
    list of base 10 integer values, and must contain at least two elements. The
    file may optionally begin with a header line; if the first line begins with
    the text "left" it will be ignored.

    Records must be listed in the file in non-decreasing order of the time
    field. Within a record, children must be listed in increasing order of node
    value. The left and right coordinates must be non-negative values.

    An example of a simple tree sequence for four samples with
    three distinct trees is::

        left    right   node    children    time    population
        2       10      4       2,3         0.071    0
        0       2       5       1,3         0.090    0
        2       10      5       1,4         0.090    0
        0       7       6       0,5         0.170    0
        7       10      7       0,5         0.202    0
        0       2       8       2,6         0.253    0

    This example is equivalent to the tree sequence illustrated in Figure 4 of
    the `PLoS Computational Biology paper
    <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004842>`_. Nodes are given here in
    time order (since this is a backwards-in-time tree sequence), but they may
    be allocated in any order. In particular, left-to-right tree sequences are
    fully supported. However, the smallest value in the ``node`` column must be
    equal to the sample size, and there must not be 'gaps' in the node address
    space.

    The optional ``mutations_file`` has a similiar format, but contains only
    two columns. These correspond to the ``position`` and ``node`` fields as
    described in the :meth:`.TreeSequence.mutations` method. The ``position``
    field is parsed as a base 10 floating point value, and the ``node`` field
    is parsed as a base 10 integer. The file may optionally begin with a header
    line; if the first line begins with the text "position" it will be ignored.

    Mutations must be listed in non-decreasing order of position, and the nodes
    must refer to a node defined by the records. Mutations defined over the
    root or a node not present in a local tree will lead to an error being
    produced during tree traversal (e.g. in the :meth:`.TreeSequence.trees`
    method, but also in many other methods).

    An example of a mutations file for the tree sequence defined in the
    previous example is::

        8.5         4
