    observed at the samples for this site; and (c) the **genotypes**
    mapping sample IDs to the observed alleles.

    Each element in the ``alleles`` tuple is a string, representing the
    actual observed state for a given sample. The first element of this
    tuple is guaranteed to be the same as the site's ``ancestral_state`` value.
    The list of alleles is also guaranteed not to contain any duplicates.
    However, allelic values may be listed that are not referred to by any
    samples. For example, if we have a site that is fixed for the derived state
    (i.e., we have a mutation over the tree root), all genotypes will be 1, but
    the alleles list will be equal to ``('0', '1')``. Other than the
    ancestral state being the first allele, the alleles are listed in
    no particular order, and the ordering should not be relied upon.

    The ``genotypes`` represent the observed allelic states for each sample,
    such that ``var.alleles[var.genotypes[j]]`` gives the string allele
    for sample ID ``j``. Thus, the elements of the genotypes array are

    Parses the tree sequence data from the specified file-like objects, and
    returns the resulting :class:`.TreeSequence` object. The format
    for these files is documented in the :ref:`sec_text_file_format` section,
    and is produced by the :meth:`.TreeSequence.dump_text` method. Further
    properties required for an input tree sequence are described in the
    :ref:`sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements` section. This method is intended as a
    convenient interface for importing external data into msprime; the HDF5
    based file format using by :meth:`msprime.load` is many times more
    efficient than this text format.

    The ``nodes`` and ``edges`` parameters are mandatory and must be file-like
    objects containing text with whitespace delimited columns,  parsable by
    :func:`parse_nodes` and :func:`parse_edges`, respectively. ``sites`` and
    ``mutations`` are optional, and must be parsable by :func:`parse_sites` and
    :func:`parse_mutations`, respectively.

    The ``sequence_length`` parameter determines the
    :attr:`.TreeSequence.sequence_length` of the returned tree sequence. If it
    is 0 or not specified, the value is taken to be the maximum right
    coordinate of the input edges. This parameter is useful in degenerate
    situations (such as when there are zero edges), but can usually be ignored.

    The ``strict`` parameter controls the field delimiting algorithm that
    is used. If ``strict`` is True (the default), we require exactly one
    tab character separating each field. If ``strict`` is False, a more relaxed
    whitespace delimiting algorithm is used, such that any run of whitespace
    is regarded as a field separator. In most situations, ``strict=False``
    is more convenient, but it can lead to error in certain situations. For
    example, if a deletion is encoded in the mutation table this will not
    be parseable when ``strict=False``.

    After parsing the tables, :func:`sort_tables` is called to ensure that
    the loaded tables satisfy the tree sequence :ref:`ordering requirements
    <sec_valid_tree_sequence_requirements>`. Note that this may result in the
    IDs of various entities changing from their positions in the input file.

        to the prefix ``msp_`` such that we would have the sample names
        ``msp_0``, ``msp_1`` and ``msp_2`` in the running example.

        :param str contig_id: The value of the CHROM column in the output VCF.
        :param bool compresslevel: Gzip compression level applied to output.

        Returns a simplified tree sequence that retains only the history of
        the nodes given in the list ``samples``. If ``map_nodes`` is true,
        also return a numpy array mapping the node IDs in this tree sequence to
        their node IDs in the simplified tree tree sequence. If a node ``u`` is not
        present in the new tree sequence, the value of this mapping will be
        NULL_NODE (-1).

        In the returned tree sequence, the node with ID ``0`` corresponds to
        ``samples[0]``, node ``1`` corresponds to ``samples[1]``, and so on. Node
        IDs in the returned tree sequence are then allocated sequentially
        in time order. Note that this does **not** necessarily mean that nodes
        in the returned tree sequence will be in strict time order (as we
        may have internal or ancient samples).

            no mutations in the simplified tree sequence. Defaults to True.

            tree sequence and a numpy array mapping node IDs in the current tree
            sequence to their corresponding node IDs in the returned tree sequence.
