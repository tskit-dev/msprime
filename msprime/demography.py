    A description of a demographic model for an msprime simulation.

    TODO document properly.

    Population structure is modelled by specifying a fixed number of
    subpopulations :math:`d`, and a :math:`d \\times d` matrix :math:`M` of
    per-generation migration rates. The :math:`(j,k)^{th}` entry of :math:`M`
    is the expected number of migrants moving from population :math:`k` to
    population :math:`j` per generation, divided by the size of population
    :math:`j`. In terms of the coalescent process, :math:`M_{j,k}` gives the
    rate at which an ancestral lineage moves from population :math:`j` to
    population :math:`k`, as one follows it back through time. In
    continuous-time models, when :math:`M_{j,k}` is close to zero, this rate is
    approximately equivalent to the fraction of population :math:`j` that is
    replaced each generation by migrants from population :math:`k`. In
    discrete-time models, the equivalence is exact and each row of :math:`M`
    has the constraint :math:`\\sum_{k \\neq j} M_{j,k} \\leq 1`. This differs
    from the migration matrix one usually uses in population demography: if
    :math:`m_{k,j}` is the proportion of individuals (in the usual sense; not
    lineages) in population :math:`k` that move to population :math:`j` per
    generation, then translating this proportion of population :math:`k` to a
    proportion of population :math:`j`, we have :math:`M_{j,k} = m_{k,j}
    \\times N_k / N_j`.

    Each subpopulation has an initial absolute population size :math:`s`
    and a per generation exponential growth rate :math:`\\alpha`. The size of a
    given population at time :math:`t` in the past (measured in generations) is
    therefore given by :math:`s e^{-\\alpha t}`. Demographic events that occur in
    the history of the simulated population alter some aspect of this population
    configuration at a particular time in the past.

        The initial sizes and growth rates for the populations in the model are
        set via the ``initial_size`` and ``growth_rate`` arguments. These can be
        specified in two ways: if a single number is provided, this is used
        for all populations. The argument may also be a mapping from population
        names to their respective values. For example:

        Note that it is possible to have default population sizes for unnamed
        ancestral populations using a `collections.defaultdict`, e.g.,

        .. code-block:: python

            tree = "(A:10.0,B:10.0)"
            initial_size = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 100)

        To compute this, an adequate time discretization must be arrived at
        by iteratively extending or refining the current discretization.
        Debugging information about numerical convergence of this procedure is
        logged using the Python :mod:`logging` infrastructure. To make it appear, using
        the :mod:`daiquiri` module, do for instance::

            import daiquiri

            daiquiri.setup(level="DEBUG")
            debugger.mean_coalescence_time([2])

        will print this debugging information to stderr. Briefly, this outputs
        iteration number, mean coalescence time, maximum difference in probabilty
        of not having coalesced yet, difference to last coalescence time,
        probability of not having coalesced by the final time point, and
        whether the last iteration was an extension or refinement.

        This function will calculate the mean coalescence rates and proportions
        of uncoalesced lineages between the lineages of the sample
        configuration provided in `num_samples`, at each of the times ago
        listed by steps, in this demographic model. The coalescence rate at
        time t in the past is the average rate of coalescence of
        as-yet-uncoalesed lineages, computed as follows: let :math:`p(t)` be
        the probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples
        has not yet coalesced by time :math:`t`, let :math:`p(z,t)` be the
        probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples has
        not yet coalesced by time :math:`t` *and* are both in population
        :math:`z`, and let :math:`N(z,t)` be the diploid effective population
        size of population :math:`z` at time :math:`t`. Then the mean
        coalescence rate at time :math:`t` is :math:`r(t) = (\\sum_z p(z,t) /
        (2 * N(z,t)) / p(t)`.

        The computation is done by approximating population size trajectories
        with piecewise constant trajectories between each of the steps. For
        this to be accurate, the distance between the steps must be small
        enough so that (a) short epochs (e.g., bottlenecks) are not missed, and
        (b) populations do not change in size too much over that time, if they
        are growing or shrinking. This function optionally provides a simple
        check of this approximation by recomputing the coalescence rates on a
        grid of steps twice as fine and throwing a warning if the resulting
        values do not match to a relative tolerance of 0.001.

        :param list num_samples: A list of the same length as the number
            of populations, so that `num_samples[j]` is the number of sampled
            chromosomes in subpopulation `j`.
        :param int min_pop_size: The smallest allowed population size during
            computation of coalescent rates (i.e., coalescence rates are actually
            1 / (2 * max(min_pop_size, N(z,t))). Spurious very small population sizes
            can occur in models where populations grow exponentially but are unused
            before some time in the past, and lead to floating point error.
            This should be set to a value smaller than the smallest
            desired population size in the model.
        :param bool double_step_validation: Whether to perform the check that
