        """
        This function will calculate the mean coalescence rates and proportions
        of uncoalesced lineages between the lineages of the sample
        configuration provided in `num_samples`, at each of the times ago
        listed by steps, in this demographic model. The coalescence rate at
        time t in the past is the average rate of coalescence of
        as-yet-uncoalesed lineages, computed as follows: let :math:`p(t)` be
        the probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples
        has not yet coalesced by time :math:`t`, let :math:`p(z,t)` be the
        probability that the lineages of a randomly chosen pair of samples has
        not yet coalesced by time :math:`t` *and* are both in population
        :math:`z`, and let :math:`N(z,t)` be the diploid effective population
        size of population :math:`z` at time :math:`t`. Then the mean
        coalescence rate at time :math:`t` is :math:`r(t) = (\\sum_z p(z,t) /
        (2 * N(z,t)) / p(t)`.

        The computation is done by approximating population size trajectories
        with piecewise constant trajectories between each of the steps. For
        this to be accurate, the distance between the steps must be small
        enough so that (a) short epochs (e.g., bottlenecks) are not missed, and
        (b) populations do not change in size too much over that time, if they
        are growing or shrinking. This function optionally provides a simple
        check of this approximation by recomputing the coalescence rates on a
        grid of steps twice as fine and throwing a warning if the resulting
        values do not match to a relative tolerance of 0.001.

        :param list steps: The times ago at which coalescence rates will be computed.
        :param list num_samples: A list of the same length as the number
            of populations, so that `num_samples[j]` is the number of sampled
            chromosomes in subpopulation `j`.
        :param int min_pop_size: The smallest allowed population size during
            computation of coalescent rates (i.e., coalescence rates are actually
            1 / (2 * max(min_pop_size, N(z,t))). Spurious very small population sizes
            can occur in models where populations grow exponentially but are unused
            before some time in the past, and lead to floating point error.
            This should be set to a value smaller than the smallest
            desired population size in the model.
        :param bool double_step_validation: Whether to perform the check that
            step sizes are sufficiently small, as described above. This is highly
            recommended, and will take at most four times the computation.
