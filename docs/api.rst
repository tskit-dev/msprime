API Documentation
=================

This is the API documentation for ``msprime``, and provides detailed information
on the Python programming interface. See the :ref:`sec_tutorial` for an
introduction to using this API to run simulations and analyse the results.

****************
Simulation model
****************

The simulation model in ``msprime`` closely follows the classical ``ms``
program. Unlike ``ms``, however, time is measured in generations rather than
"coalescent units". Internally the same simulation algorithm is used, but
``msprime`` provides a translation layer to allow the user input times and
rates in generations. Similarly, the times associated with the trees produced
by ``msprime`` are in measured generations. To enable this translation from
generations into coalescent units and vice-versa, a reference effective
population size must be provided, which is given by the ``Ne`` parameter in the
:func:`.simulate` function. (Note that we assume diploid population sizes
thoughout, since we scale by :math:`4 N_e`.) Population sizes for individual
demes and for past demographic events are defined as absolute values, **not**
scaled by ``Ne``. All migration rates and growth rates are also per generation.

When running simulations we define the length in bases :math:`L` of the
sequence in question using the ``length`` parameter. This defines the
coordinate space within which trees and mutations are defined. :math:`L` is a
continuous value, and coordinates can take any value from :math:`0` to
:math:`L`. Mutations occur in an infinite sites process along this sequence,
and mutation rates are specified per generation, per unit of sequence length.
Thus, given the per-generation mutation rate :math:`\mu`, the rate of mutation
over the entire sequence in coalescent time units is :math:`\theta = 4 N_e \mu
L`. It is important to remember these scaling factors when comparing with
analytical results!

Similarly, recombination rates are per base, per generation in ``msprime``.
Thus, given the per generation crossover rate :math:`r`, the overall rate
of recombination between the ends of the sequence in coalescent time units
is :math:`\rho = 4 N_e r L`. Recombination events occur in a continuous
coordinate space, so that breakpoints do not necessarily occur at integer
locations. However, the underlying recombination model is finite, and the
behaviour of a small number of loci can be modelled using the
:class:`RecombinationMap` class. However, this is considered an advanced
feature and the majority of cases should be well served with the default
recombination model and number of loci.

Population structure is modelled by specifying a fixed number of demes
:math:`d`, and a :math:`d \times d` matrix :math:`M` of per generation
migration rates. Each element of the matrix :math:`M_{j,k}` defines
the fraction of population :math:`j` that consists of migrants from
population :math:`k` in each generation.
Each deme has an initial absolute population size :math:`s`
and a per generation exponential growth rate :math:`\alpha`. The size of a
given population at time :math:`t` in the past (measured in generations) is
therefore given by :math:`s e^{-\alpha t}`. Demographic events that occur in
the history of the simulated population alter some aspect of this population
configuration at a particular time in the past.

.. warning:: This parameterisation of recombination, mutation and
    migration rates is different to :program:`ms`, which states these
    rates over the entire region and in coalescent time units. The
    motivation for this is to allow the user change the size of the simulated
    region without having to rescale the recombination and mutation rates,
    and to also allow users directly state times and rates in units of
    generations. However, the ``mspms`` command line application is
    fully :program:`ms` compatible.

*******************
Running simulations
*******************

The :func:`.simulate` function provides the primary interface to running
coalescent simulations in msprime.

.. autofunction:: msprime.simulate

++++++++++++++++++++
Population structure
++++++++++++++++++++

Population structure is modelled in ``msprime`` by specifying a fixed number of
demes, with the migration rates between those demes defined by a migration
matrix. Each deme has an ``initial_size`` that defines its absolute size at
time zero and a per-generation ``growth_rate`` which specifies the exponential
growth rate of the sub-population. We must also define the size of the sample
to draw from each deme. The number of populations and their initial
configuration is defined using the ``population_configurations`` parameter to
:func:`.simulate`, which takes a list of :class:`.PopulationConfiguration`
instances. Population IDs are zero indexed, and correspond to their position in
the list.

Samples are drawn sequentially from populations in increasing order of
population ID. For example, if we specified an overall sample size of 5, and
specify that 2 samples are drawn from population 0 and 3 from population 1,
then individuals 0 and 1 will be initially located in population 0, and
individuals 2, 3 and 4 will be drawn from population 2.

Given :math:`N` populations, migration matrices are specified using an :math:`N
\times N` matrix of deme-to-deme migration rates. See the documentation for
:func:`.simulate` and the `Simulation model`_ section for more details on the
migration rates.

.. autoclass:: msprime.PopulationConfiguration

++++++++++++++++++
Demographic Events
++++++++++++++++++

Demographic events change some aspect of the population configuration
at some time in the past, and are specified using the ``demographic_events``
parameter to :func:`.simulate`. Each element of this list must be an
instance of one of the following demographic events
that are currently supported. Note that all times are measured in
generations, all sizes are absolute (i.e., *not* relative to :math:`N_e`),
and all rates are per-generation.

*******************
Processing results
*******************

The :class:`.TreeSequence` class represents a sequence of correlated trees
output by a simulation. The :class:`.SparseTree` class represents a single
tree in this sequence.

+++++++++
Constants
+++++++++

.. data:: msprime.NULL_NODE = -1

    Special reserved value, representing the null node. If the parent of a
    given node is null, then this node is either a root (the ancestor of
    one or more samples), or the node is not present in the current tree.

.. data:: msprime.NULL_POPULATION = -1

    Special reserved value, representing the null population ID. This value is
    returned if the population associated with a particular node is not
    defined, or population information was not available in the underlying tree
    sequence.

.. data:: msprime.NULL_MUTATION = -1

    Special reserved value, representing the null mutation ID. If there is a
    single mutation at a site, or if a mutation at a given site does not have
    an ancestal mutations it inherited from, this is the value returned by
    ``mutation.parent``. See also :class:`.Mutation`.


.. data:: msprime.FORWARD = 1

    Constant representing the forward direction of travel (i.e.,
    increasing coordinate values).

.. data:: msprime.REVERSE = -1

    Constant representing the reverse direction of travel (i.e.,
    decreasing coordinate values).

++++++++++++
Loading data
++++++++++++

There are several methods for loading data into the msprime API. The simplest
and most convenient is the use the :func:`msprime.load` function to load
a :ref:`HDF ancestry file <sec_hdf5_file_format>`. For small scale data
and debugging, it is often convenient to use the :func:`msprime.load_text`
to read data in the :ref:`text file format <sec_text_file_format>`.
The :func:`msprime.load_tables` function efficiently loads large volumes
of data using the :ref:`Tables API <sec_tables_api>`.

.. autofunction:: msprime.load_text

.. autofunction:: msprime.load_tables


+++++++++++++++++
Top level-classes

These classes are the interfaces used to interact with the trees
and mutational information stored in a tree sequence. The :class:`.TreeSequence`
class represents a single tree sequence, and the :class:`.SparseTree` class
represents a single tree in a tree sequence.

These classes are simple shallow containers representing the entities defined
in the :ref:`sec_data_model`. These classes are not intended to be instantiated
directly, but are the return types for the various iterators provided by the

.. _sec_tables_api:

***********
Tables API
***********

The :ref:`tables API <sec_binary_interchange>` provides an efficient way of working
with and interchanging :ref:`tree sequence data <sec_data_model>`. Each table
class (e.g, :class:`.NodeTable`, :class:`.EdgeTable`) has a specific set of
columns with fixed types, and a set of methods for setting and getting the data
in these columns. The number of rows in the table ``t`` is given by ``len(t)``.
Each table supports accessing the data either by row or column. To access the
row ``j`` in table ``t`` simply use ``t[j]``. The value returned by such an
access is an instance of :func:`collections.namedtuple`, and therefore supports
either positional or named attribute access. To access the data in
a column, we can use standard attribute access which will return a numpy array
of the data. For example::

    >>> import msprime
    >>> t = msprime.EdgeTable()
    >>> t.add_row(left=0, right=1, parent=10, child=11)
    0
    >>> t.add_row(left=1, right=2, parent=9, child=11)
    1
    >>> print(t)
    id      left            right           parent  child
    0       0.00000000      1.00000000      10      11
    1       1.00000000      2.00000000      9       11
    >>> t[0]
    EdgeTableRow(left=0.0, right=1.0, parent=10, child=11)
    >>> t[-1]
    EdgeTableRow(left=1.0, right=2.0, parent=9, child=11)
    >>> t.left
    array([ 0.,  1.])
    >>> t.parent
    array([10,  9], dtype=int32)
    >>> len(t)
    2
    >>>

Tables also support the :mod:`pickle` protocol, and so can be easily
serialised and deserialised (for example, when performing parallel
computations using the :mod:`multiprocessing` module). ::

    >>> serialised = pickle.dumps(t)
    >>> t2 = pickle.loads(serialised)
    >>> print(t2)
    id      left            right           parent  child
    0       0.00000000      1.00000000      10      11
    1       1.00000000      2.00000000      9       11

However, pickling will not be as efficient as storing tables
in the native :ref:`HDF5 format <sec_hdf5_file_format>`.

Tables support the equality operator ``==`` based on the data
held in the columns::

    >>> t == t2
    True
    >>> t is t2
    False
    >>> t2.add_row(0, 1, 2, 3)
    2
    >>> print(t2)
    id      left            right           parent  child
    0       0.00000000      1.00000000      10      11
    1       1.00000000      2.00000000      9       11
    2       0.00000000      1.00000000      2       3
    >>> t == t2
    False



.. _sec_tables_api_text_columns:

++++++++++++
Text columns
++++++++++++

As described in the :ref:`sec_encoding_ragged_columns`, working with
variable length columns is somewhat more involved. Columns
encoding text data store the **encoded bytes** of the flattened
strings, and the offsets into this column in two separate
arrays.

Consider the following example::

    >>> t = msprime.SiteTable()
    >>> t.add_row(0, "A")
    >>> t.add_row(1, "BB")
    >>> t.add_row(2, "")
    >>> t.add_row(3, "CCC")
    >>> print(t)
    id      position        ancestral_state metadata
    0       0.00000000      A
    1       1.00000000      BB
    2       2.00000000
    3       3.00000000      CCC
    >>> t[0]
    SiteTableRow(position=0.0, ancestral_state='A', metadata=b'')
    >>> t[1]
    SiteTableRow(position=1.0, ancestral_state='BB', metadata=b'')
    >>> t[2]
    SiteTableRow(position=2.0, ancestral_state='', metadata=b'')
    >>> t[3]
    SiteTableRow(position=3.0, ancestral_state='CCC', metadata=b'')

Here we create a :class:`.SiteTable` and add four rows, each with a different
``ancestral_state``. We can then access this information from each
row in a straightforward manner. Working with the data in the columns
is a little trickier, however::

    >>> t.ancestral_state
    array([65, 66, 66, 67, 67, 67], dtype=int8)
    >>> t.ancestral_state_offset
    array([0, 1, 3, 3, 6], dtype=uint32)
    >>> msprime.unpack_strings(t.ancestral_state, t.ancestral_state_offset)
    ['A', 'BB', '', 'CCC']

Here, the ``ancestral_state`` array is the UTF8 encoded bytes of the flattened
strings, and the ``ancestral_state_offset`` is the offset into this array
for each row. The :func:`.unpack_strings` function, however, is a convient
way to recover the original strings from this encoding. We can also use the
:func:`.pack_strings` to insert data using this approach::

    >>> a, off = msprime.pack_strings(["0", "12", ""])
    >>> t.set_columns(position=[0, 1, 2], ancestral_state=a, ancestral_state_offset=off)
    >>> print(t)
    id      position        ancestral_state metadata
    0       0.00000000      0
    1       1.00000000      12
    2       2.00000000

When inserting many rows with standard infinite sites mutations (i.e.,
ancestral state is "0"), it is more efficient to construct the
numpy arrays directly than to create a list of strings and use
:func:`.pack_strings`. When doing this, it is important to note that
it is the **encoded** byte values that are stored; by default, we
use UTF8 (which corresponds to ASCII for simple printable characters).::

    >>> t_s = msprime.SiteTable()
    >>> m = 10
    >>> a = ord("0") + np.zeros(m, dtype=np.int8)
    >>> off = np.arange(m + 1, dtype=np.uint32)
    >>> t_s.set_columns(position=np.arange(m), ancestral_state=a, ancestral_state_offset=off)
    >>> print(t_s)
    id      position        ancestral_state metadata
    0       0.00000000      0
    1       1.00000000      0
    2       2.00000000      0
    3       3.00000000      0
    4       4.00000000      0
    5       5.00000000      0
    6       6.00000000      0
    7       7.00000000      0
    8       8.00000000      0
    9       9.00000000      0
    >>> t_s.ancestral_state
    array([48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48, 48], dtype=int8)
    >>> t_s.ancestral_state_offset
    array([ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10], dtype=uint32)

Here we create 10 sites at regular positions, each with ancestral state equal to
"0". Note that we use ``ord("0")`` to get the ASCII code for "0" (48), and create
10 copies of this by adding it to an array of zeros.

Mutations can be handled similarly::

    >>> t_m = msprime.MutationTable()
    >>> site = np.arange(m, dtype=np.int32)
    >>> d = ord("1") + np.zeros(m, dtype=np.int8)
    >>> off = np.arange(m + 1, dtype=np.uint32)
    >>> node = np.zeros(m, dtype=np.int32)
    >>> t_m.set_columns(site=site, node=node, derived_state=d, derived_state_offset=off)
    >>> print(t_m)
    id      site    node    derived_state   parent  metadata
    0       0       0       1       -1
    1       1       0       1       -1
    2       2       0       1       -1
    3       3       0       1       -1
    4       4       0       1       -1
    5       5       0       1       -1

    7       7       0       1       -1
    8       8       0       1       -1

.. _sec_tables_api_binary_columns:

++++++++++++++
Binary columns
++++++++++++++

Columns storing binary data take the same approach as
:ref:`sec_tables_api_text_columns` to encoding
:ref:`variable length data <sec_encoding_ragged_columns>`.
The difference between the two is
only raw :class:`bytes` values are accepted: no character encoding or
decoding is done on the data. Consider the following example::


    >>> t = msprime.NodeTable()
    >>> t.add_row(metadata=b"raw bytes")
    >>> t.add_row(metadata=pickle.dumps({"x": 1.1}))
    >>> t[0].metadata
    b'raw bytes'
    >>> t[1].metadata
    b'\x80\x03}q\x00X\x01\x00\x00\x00xq\x01G?\xf1\x99\x99\x99\x99\x99\x9as.'
    >>> pickle.loads(t[1].metadata)
    {'x': 1.1}
    >>> print(t)
    id      flags   population      time    metadata
    0       0       -1      0.00000000000000        cmF3IGJ5dGVz
    1       0       -1      0.00000000000000        gAN9cQBYAQAAAHhxAUc/8ZmZmZmZmnMu
    >>> t.metadata
    array([ 114,   97,  119,   32,   98,  121,  116,  101,  115, -128,    3,
            125,  113,    0,   88,    1,    0,    0,    0,  120,  113,    1,
             71,   63,  -15, -103, -103, -103, -103, -103, -102,  115,   46], dtype=int8)
    >>> t.metadata_offset
    array([ 0,  9, 33], dtype=uint32)


Here we add two rows to a :class:`.NodeTable`, with different
:ref:`metadata <sec_metadata_definition>`. The first row contains a simple
byte string, and the second contains a Python dictionary serialised using
:mod:`pickle`. We then show several different (and seemingly incompatible!)
different views on the same data.

When we access the data in a row (e.g., ``t[0].metadata``) we are returned
a Python bytes object containing precisely the bytes that were inserted.
The pickled dictionary is encoded in 24 bytes containing unprintable
characters, and when we unpickle it using :func:`pickle.loads`, we obtain
the original dictionary.

When we print the table, however, we see some data which is seemingly
unrelated to the original contents. This is because the binary data is
`base64 encoded <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>`_ to ensure
that it is print-safe (and doesn't break your terminal). (See the
:ref:`sec_metadata_definition` section for more information on the
use of base64 encoding.).

Finally, when we print the ``metadata`` column, we see the raw byte values
encoded as signed integers. As for :ref:`sec_tables_api_text_columns`,
the ``metadata_offset`` column encodes the offsets into this array. So, we
see that the metadata value is 9 bytes long and the second is 24.

The :func:`pack_bytes` and :func:`unpack_bytes` functions are also useful
for encoding data in these columns.
