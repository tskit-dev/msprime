# Mutation simulations

{ref}`Ancestry simulations<sec_ancestry>` in msprime simulate a random
ancestral history of a set of sampled genomes. While the trees representing
this history are very useful (and often all we need, for many purposes),
they do not include any information about what the actual genome **sequences**
would look like for these samples. To produce genetic variation data
(as represented by a [VCF file](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf),
for example), we need to simulate some extra information: we need
*mutations*. Msprime provides a powerful and efficient way of superimposing
neutral mutations from a range of sequence evolution
{ref}`models <sec_mutations_models>` using the {func}`.sim_mutations`
function.

For example, here we simulate the ancestry of two diploids (and therefore
four sample genomes) and store the resulting {class}`tskit.TreeSequence`
object in the ``ts`` variable. We then simulate some mutations on
that tree sequence, and show the resulting tree with mutations:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(2, sequence_length=100, random_seed=1234)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.01, random_seed=5678)
SVG(mts.draw_svg())
```

We can see the variation data produced by these mutations most simply
via the {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.variants` method:

```{code-cell}
for var in mts.variants():
    print(var.site.position, var.alleles, var.genotypes, sep="\t")
```

The [tskit](https://tskit.dev/tskit) library has many powerful
methods for working with mutation data --- see the
{ref}`tutorials:sec_tskit_getting_started` tutorial
for more information.

(sec_mutations_rate)=

## Specifying rates

The `rate` parameter of {func}`.sim_mutations` determines the rate of mutations per unit
of sequence length per generation. A rate must be specified for mutations to be generated.

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(2, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1, random_seed=1)
mts.num_mutations
```

Running {func}`.sim_mutations` on this simulated tree of length 1 with `rate=1`
produces 7 mutations.

Specifying higher rates lead to proportionately more mutations:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(2, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=5, random_seed=1)
mts.num_mutations
```

It's also possible to provide a {class}`.RateMap` which specifies variable
mutation rates over different stretches of the sequence.

In the following example, the mutation rate between positions 0 and 2 is 0.5,
between positions 2 and 5 is 0, and between positions 5 and 10 is 0.1:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(4, sequence_length=7, random_seed=1)
ratemap = msprime.RateMap(position=[0, 2, 5, 7], rate=[0.5, 0, 0.1])
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=ratemap, random_seed=10)
SVG(mts.draw_svg(node_labels={}, size=(400, 300)))
```

As we can see from the output, there are three mutations at site 0 (position 0),
three mutations at site 1 (position 1), no mutations between positions 2 and 5
(where the mutation rate is zero) and one mutation at site 2 (position 5).
This illustrates that as the rate increases, the probability of recurrent mutation
(multiple mutations at a site) also increases.

:::{note}

If using a {class}`.RateMap` with {func}`.sim_mutations`, be sure that the final
position of the {class}`.RateMap` is the same as the
`sequence_length` of the tree sequence you're adding mutations to!

:::

(sec_mutations_discrete)=

## Discrete or continuous

As in {func}`.sim_ancestry` (see {ref}`sec_ancestry_discrete_genome`),
the `discrete_genome` parameter controls whether mutations should be placed at
discrete, integer coordinates or continuously at floating point positions.
`discrete_genome=True` is the default:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(4, sequence_length=5, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.1, random_seed=5)
mts.tables.sites.position
```

Specifying `discrete_genome=False` places mutations at floating point positions
continuously along the genome.

```{code-cell}
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.1, random_seed=5, discrete_genome=False)
mts.tables.sites.position
```

:::{note}

Using `discrete_genome=False` means that the mutation model will conform
to the classic *infinite sites* assumption, where each mutation in the simulation
occurs at a new site.

:::

(sec_mutations_time_span)=

## Restricting time span

The time range where mutations can be placed is specified using the `start_time`
and `end_time` parameters. For instance, the following only allows mutations to occur
earlier than time ``1`` in the tree:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(2, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=2, start_time=1, random_seed=1)
mts.tables.mutations.time
```

Note, however, that the child node of the edge where the mutation occurred can be younger
than `start_time`.

```{code-cell}
mts.tables.nodes.time[mts.tables.mutations.node]
```

It is also possible to use multiple calls of {func}`.sim_mutations` with `start_time`
and `end_time` specified to simulate differing mutation rates at different
periods of time. For instance, the following code simulates mutations at a low rate
prior to time ``1`` and at a higher rate more recently.

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(2, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.1, start_time=1, random_seed=1)
print(mts.tables.mutations.time)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(mts, rate=4, end_time=1, random_seed=1)
print(mts.tables.mutations.time)
```

As explained in {ref}`the following section <sec_mutations_existing>`, reversing the order of these two
lines will result in an error, as older mutations must be added first.

(sec_mutations_silent)=

## Silent mutations

Some of these mutation models produce *silent mutations*,
that do not change the allelic state.
For instance, here are all the mutations in a small simulation
using the {class}`.HKY`:

```{code-cell}
def count_transitions(ts, alleles):
    counts = np.zeros((len(alleles), len(alleles)), dtype='int')
    for s in ts.sites():
        aa = s.ancestral_state
        for m in s.mutations:
            pa = aa
            da = m.derived_state
            if m.parent != tskit.NULL:
                pa = ts.mutation(m.parent).derived_state
            counts[alleles.index(pa), alleles.index(da)] += 1
    print("\t", "\t".join(alleles))
    for j, a in enumerate(alleles):
        print(f"{a}\t", "\t".join(map(str, counts[j])))

model = msprime.HKY(kappa=0.75, equilibrium_frequencies=[0.2, 0.3, 0.3, 0.2])
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    5, random_seed=1, sequence_length=1e7, recombination_rate=1e-8,
    population_size=1000)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-8, model=model, random_seed=1)
count_transitions(mts, model.alleles)
```

There are a moderate but small number of C->C and G->G mutations.
This is because under the HKY model with these parameters,
the mutation rates for C and G is less than that of A and T.
However, msprime puts down mutations on the trees at *constant* rate;
and so to make the mutation process correct, some of these "mutations"
are chosen to be silent.
See {ref}`sec_mutations_matrix_mutation_theory` for more details on how this works.

Such silent mutations might be surprising, but they are harmless:
they do not affect summary statistics
(e.g., {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.diversity`)
or genotypes in any way.
In fact, leaving them in makes msprime's mutation process *more* robust:
see {ref}`sec_mutations_state_independence` for details.

To demonstrate insensitivity to these silent mutations,
let's compute the number of segregating sites for the mutated tree sequence above.
Here's how many sites it has mutations at:

```{code-cell}
print(f"The tree sequence has {mts.num_sites} sites with mutations.")
```

So, we might expect the total number of segregating sites to be 1182.
However, some are silent, and subtracting the number of these gets the same answer as
{meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.segregating_sites`:

```{code-cell}
num_silent = 0
for s in mts.sites():
    for m in s.mutations:
        pa = s.ancestral_state
        if m.parent != tskit.NULL:
            pa = mts.mutation(m.parent).derived_state
        if pa == m.derived_state:
            num_silent += 1

segsites = mts.segregating_sites(span_normalise=False)

print(f"The tree sequence has {num_silent} silent mutations,\n"
      f"and {segsites} segregating sites.")
```

Indeed, 1182 - 75 = 1107.

(sec_mutations_existing)=

## Existing mutations

When you add mutations to a tree sequence which already contains them, the `keep` parameter
controls whether existing mutations are kept or discarded (the default is `keep=True`).
For instance, in final code block in {ref}`sec_mutations_time_span`, mutations were
progressively added to a simulated tree sequence, beginning with the oldest time period.
This could also be used to add mutations with different mutation models to different segments
of the genome.

While it is more natural to add younger mutations to a tree sequence which already contains
older mutations, you can also add mutations ancestral to existing mutations,
as in the following code block:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(5, random_seed=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1, random_seed=1)
mmts = msprime.sim_mutations(mts, rate=0.1, random_seed=5)
print(f"Before: {mts.num_mutations} mutations.\n"
      f"After: {mmts.num_mutations} mutations.")
```

This might be done, for instance, if a tree sequence is the result of a forwards
simulation that has non-neutral variation, and you'd like to add neutral mutations.

(sec_mutations_state_independence)=

### Silent mutations and state-independence

Although it is possible to add new mutations ancestrally to
existing mutations, doing so can produce confusing situations.
For instance, new mutations added to an already mutated site
will not assign a new ancestral state: for instance, with the
{class}`.PAM` of amino acid mutation,
if a site has ancestral state ``V`` and a mutation with derived state ``I``,
and a new mutation is added ancestral to the existing one,
the derived state of the new mutation will be randomly assigned
(rather than being ``V`` as you might expect).
This can lead to unlikely or even impossible situations:
the new mutation in this example might be a ``G``,
since mutations from ``V`` to ``G`` and ``V`` to ``I`` are both reasonably likely.
However, a mutation from ``G`` to ``I`` is impossible under this model,
and we now have the chain V->G->I
(the chain is possible under the {class}`.BLOSUM62`, but unlikely).
In practice this is more confusing than concerning,
since it can only happen when the same site is mutated more than once,
which affects only a small proportion of sites.

The situation above occurred because the probability of mutating to ``I``
was very different depending on the initial state.
However, if derived alleles are chosen in a way *independent* of the previous state,
then adding mutations at rate {math}`\alpha`
and then adding mutations at rate {math}`\beta`
is *equivalent* to adding mutations once, at rate {math}`\alpha + \beta`.
A mutation model has this property if rows of its transition matrix are the same,
and is called *state independent* (or, *parent independent*).
For instance, mutations under the {class}`.JC69`
choose *any* derived allele with equal probability.
This means that the *result* of a mutation can be chosen without knowing
what the previous state at that site was ("state independence"),
which implies that adding new mutations above a given mutation does not affect
the probability of that mutation occurring.
However, this is only true if "any derived allele" includes the previous allele,
i.e., if we include {ref}`silent mutations <sec_mutations_silent>`.
The default Jukes-Cantor model will mutate an ``A`` to either a ``C``, ``G``, or ``T``
with equal probability, which we can check by looking at the *transition matrix*,
whose rows give the probability that each allele mutates into each other allele
(see {ref}`sec_mutations_matrix_mutations_models` for more):

```{code-cell}
jc69 = msprime.JC69()
jc69.transition_matrix
```

We can check that this does not produce any silent mutations:

```{code-cell}
rate = 1.5e-3
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(5, random_seed=5, sequence_length=1e6)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=rate, model=jc69, random_seed=7)
count_transitions(mts, jc69.alleles)
```

Although this model does not include silent mutations,
applying it more than once could produce some -
for instance, if one mutation with derived state ``C`` is inserted
above an existing mutation with the same derived state.
To make it state-independent, we have to choose the derived state
uniformly from *all* nucleotides:

```{code-cell}
pi_jc69 = msprime.JC69(state_independent=True)
pi_jc69.transition_matrix
```

With this change, mutating twice with {class}`.JC69`
is *equivalent* to mutating once with rate equal to the sum of the rates.
In other words, these two operations are equivalent:

```{code-cell}
alpha = 0.4 * rate
beta = 0.6 * rate
# mutate once:
mts1 = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=alpha + beta, model=pi_jc69, random_seed=7)
print("Mutated once:")
count_transitions(mts1, pi_jc69.alleles)
# or, mutate twice:
mts2 = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=alpha, model=pi_jc69, random_seed=7)
mts2 = msprime.sim_mutations(mts2, rate=beta, model=pi_jc69, random_seed=8)
print("Mutated twice:")
count_transitions(mts2, pi_jc69.alleles)
```

These are very similar - any differences are due to statistical noise.

However, now 25% of the mutations are silent.
These silent mutations are harmless, and will not affect most things at all.
However, they do count as mutations, and so including them decreases the
effective mutation rate.
Above, we produced ``mts`` by mutating with the default Jukes-Cantor model
at rate 1.5. Here, we produced ``mts1`` (and ``mts2``) using Jukes-Cantor
but with 25% of the mutations silent.
This means that to produce an set of mutations equivalent to ``mts``
that includes silent mutations, we need to use the state-independent
Jukes-Cantor model with rate {math}`1/(1-0.25) = 4/3` times higher:

```{code-cell}
mts_with_silent = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=rate * 4/3, model=pi_jc69, random_seed=12)
count_transitions(mts_with_silent, pi_jc69.alleles)
```

Note that the offdiagonal counts are similar to what we saw above for ``mts`` -
again, any differences are due to statistical noise.
Another way to see this is that nucleotide diversity is similar for ``mts`` and ``mts_with_silent``,
but is only 75% as big for ``mts1``:

```{code-cell}
print(f"Nucleotide diversity for default JC69 with rate {rate}: {mts.diversity():.4f}")
print(f"               state-independent JC69 with rate {rate}: {mts1.diversity():.4f}")
print(f"               state-independent JC69 with rate {rate * 4/3}: {mts_with_silent.diversity():.4f}")
```

Here's the takeaways from this section:

```{attention}
1. If you're going to add mutations to the same tree sequence more than once,
    you should use the ``state_independent`` mutation models
    (or carefully consider the consequences).
2. If you use a state-independent model, you need to make your mutation rate higher,
    to account for the silent mutations. See {ref}`sec_mutations_adjusting_for_silent`
    for more details.
```

(sec_mutations_models)=

## Models

(sec_mutations_matrix_mutations_models)=

### Matrix Mutation Models

These classes are defined by an alphabet of possible alleles (`alleles`); an array of
probabilities that determines how likely each allele is to be the root or ancestral
allele (`root_distribution`); and a `transition_matrix` specifying the probabilities
with which a given mutation changes each allele into each other allele.
Each class generates particular values for these parameters to create the specific model.
For your own custom model these parameters can be set using
{class}`msprime.MatrixMutationModel`. For more detail about how mutations are simulated
in these models see {ref}`sec_mutations_matrix_mutation_theory`.

(sec_mutations_matrix_mutation_models_details)=

#### Mutation Matrix Models Details

Mutation matrix models are specified by three things: an alphabet,
a root distribution, and a transition matrix.
These leave one free parameter: an overall mutation rate,
specified by the mutation `rate` in the call to {func}`.sim_mutations`.
Concisely,
the underlying model of mutation is a continuous-time Markov chain on the alphabet,
started by a draw from `root_distribution`, and
with instantaneous transition rate from `i` to `j` that is equal to
`rate` multiplied by `transition_matrix[i,j]`.
The `root distribution` and every row in the `transition_matrix`
must give *probabilities*, i.e., they must be nonnegative numbers summing to 1.
For the precise interpretation of these parameters
(especially when the transition matrix has nonzero entries on the diagonal)
see {ref}`sec_mutations_matrix_mutation_theory`.

You can define your own, but you probably don't need to:
there are several mutation matrix models already implemented in `msprime`,
using binary (0/1), nucleotide, or amino acid alphabets:

#### Defining your own finite-sites model

If you want to define your own {class}`.MatrixMutationModel`, you have a good
deal of freedom. For instance, here's a "decomposition/growth/disturbance"
mutation model, where the only possible transitions are 🎄 to 🔥, 🔥 to 💩, and
💩 to 🎄, with the first transition happening at one-fifth the rate of the
other two:

```{code-cell} python

alleles = ["💩", "🎄", "🔥"]
model = msprime.MatrixMutationModel(
    alleles,
    root_distribution = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    transition_matrix = [[0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
                         [0.0, 0.8, 0.2],
                         [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]]
)
rate = 2
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(6, population_size=10, random_seed=2, sequence_length=7)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=rate, random_seed=1, model=model)

```

We have simulated from this model at rate 2, so the overall rate of mutation
from 💩 to 🎄 and 🔥 to 💩 is 2, and from 🎄 to 🔥 is {math}`2 \times 0.2 = 0.4`.
As a result, roughly 5/7th of the states will be 🎄, with the remainder
divided evenly between 💩 and 🔥. Here is the resulting "genotype matrix":

```{code-cell}
for v in mts.variants():
   print("".join(v.alleles[k] for k in v.genotypes))

```

(sec_mutations_matrix_mutation_theory)=

#### Parameterisation of Matrix Mutation Models

To interpret the `root_distribution` and `transition_matrix` parameters,
it helps to know how the underlying mutational process is implemented.
First, mutations are placed on the tree,
with a mean density equal to the `rate`, per unit of time and sequence length.
If `discrete_genome=False` then this is an infinite-sites model,
so each mutation occurs at a distinct position along the genome.
If `discrete_genome=True` (the default setting) then at each integer position,
each branch of the tree at that position gets a Poisson number of mutations
with mean equal to `rate` multiplied by the length of the branch.
Next, each site that has a mutation is assigned an ancestral state,
i.e., the allele at the root of the tree at that position,
by drawing an allele from the probabilities in the `root_distribution`.
Now, each mutation is examined, moving down the tree,
and a derived state is chosen using the probabilities given in the
row of the `transition_matrix` that corresponds to the "parental state",
i.e., the allele that this mutation will replace.
Importantly, the mutation is recorded even if the chosen allele is the same
as the parental allele - so, if the diagonal of the transition matrix
contains nonzero entries, then the mutated tree sequence will
(probably) contain silent mutations.

Some facts about Markov chains are useful to interpret the statistics
of these mutation models. First, suppose we have tabulated all mutations, and so
for each pair of alleles {math}`i` and {math}`j` we have the proportion of mutations
that caused an {math}`i \to j` change. If allele {math}`i` mutates to a different allele,
the chance it mutates to allele {math}`j` is proportional to `transition_matrix[i,j]` but
excluding the diagonal (no-change) entry, so is equal to
`transition_matrix[i,j] / (1 - transition_matrix[i,i])`.
Second, suppose that an ancestor carries allele {math}`i` at a given position.
The probability {math}`P(t)` that her descendant some time {math}`t` in the future
carries allele {math}`j` can be found using the scaled
[infinitesimal rate matrix](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transition_rate_matrix>) of
the Markov chain, {math}`Q`, and taking its matrix exponential:

```{code-cell} python
import scipy

Q = model.transition_matrix - np.eye(len(model.alleles))
t = 0.1  # time
scaled_Q = t * rate * Q
Pt = scipy.linalg.expm(scaled_Q)


print("P(t) = probs of allele change along a branch of length", t)
print()
print("    ----  End  state ----")
print(" ".join(f"{s:>6}" for s in model.alleles))
for i, s in enumerate(model.alleles):
    print(f"{s} " + " ".join(f"{Pt[i,j]:.5f}" for j in range(len(model.alleles))))
```

If the top of a branch of length {math}`t` has allele {math}`i`,
the bottom of the branch has allele {math}`j` with probability `Pt[i,j]`. Note that
these values are sometimes called the "transition probabilities" for a branch, and
therefore you may see the matrix {math}`P(t)` also being refered to as a
"transition matrix"; this should not be confused with the probabilities of a single
mutation resulting in each allele type, as specified via the `transition_matrix`
parameter and stored under that name as an attribute of the underlying
{class}`msprime.MatrixMutationModel`.

(sec_mutations_adjusting_for_silent)=

#### Adjusting mutation rates for silent mutations

As discussed in {ref}`sec_mutations_silent`, matrix mutation models can insert *silent* mutations,
which may make it difficult to set the mutation rate appropriately,
since by "mutation rate" we mean the rate of appearance of mutations that *change* the allelic state.
However, the "mutation rate" is not in fact a single value: it depends on context,
as some alleles may tend to mutate more than others.

As an example of how to appropriately adjust the mutation rate to produce a given expected diversity,
take the following somewhat contrived problem.
Suppose we generate a tree sequence of 1000 samples of 10Mb from a population of size 1,000,
which has mutations generated under the HKY model with {math}`\kappa = 0.75`
and equilibrium frequencies {math}`\pi = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]`.
We'd like to choose the mutation rate {math}`\mu` so that the mean genetic diversity
is equal to 0.001.
If this was equal to the usual {math}`\theta = 4Nu`, we'd need a "mutation rate"
of {math}`u = 2.5 \times 10^{-7}`, so we know we'll need a number slightly higher than that.

To do this, let's figure out the mean rate of appearance of silent mutations.
We know that (a) the rate of appearance of silent mutations per nucleotide is given by {math}`\mu`
times the diagonal of the transition matrix, and (b) the equilibrium frequency of the four
nucleotides is given by {math}`\pi`. Multiplying these together and adding them up
gives us the expected proportion of mutations that are silent.
Now, writing that we want {math}`u` to equal {math}`\mu` times one minus the this proportion,
we get {math}`2.5 \times 10^{-7} = \mu (1 - \sum_i \pi_i P_{ii})`, so
solving for {math}`\mu` gives us:

```{code-cell}
pi = np.array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])
hky = msprime.HKY(kappa=0.75, equilibrium_frequencies=pi)
P = hky.transition_matrix
u = 2.5e-7
mu = u / (1 - np.sum(pi * np.diag(P)))
print(f"Mutation rate should be increased by a factor of {mu/u:.2f}.")
```

Now, let's verify we get the nucleotide diversity we were aiming for:

```{code-cell}
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(1000, population_size=1000, sequence_length=1e7, recombination_rate=1e-8, random_seed=5)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=mu, model=hky, random_seed=27)
theta = mts.diversity()
print(f"Genetic diversity: {theta}.")
```

That's pretty close to 0.001! The difference is within statistical error.

### Microsatellite Mutation Models

We have implemented a number of mutational models that are commonly used
to model the evolution of microsatellite repeats.
The basic idea here is that the number of copies of a given repeat is
tracked, and its evolution over time subject to one of a number of potential
biases.

Consider the [Combined DNA Index System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_DNA_Index_System) 
(CODIS), a US National database
of genotypes maintained by the justice system for use in forensic DNA analysis.
The CODIS system relies on 20 core microsatellite loci, that are unlinked across
the human genome. Let's simulate a sample of 5 individuals at 20 unlinked loci,
and then apply the {class}`.SMM` model to the sample.
After running the simulation we then examine the variation across the loci, by
iterating through the variants.

```{note}
The alleles in {class}`.MicrosatMutationModel`s such as this represent the
copy number of the repeat, not the actual sequences observed. See below for some basic
techniques for working with this kind of data.
```

```{code-cell} python

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(5, random_seed=2, sequence_length=20,
    recombination_rate=0.5, population_size=100_000)
model = msprime.SMM(lo=1, hi=10)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-5, model=model, random_seed=1)
for var in mts.variants():
    print("Site at:", var.site.position)
    print("    Alleles:", var.alleles)
    print("    Genotypes:", var.genotypes)
```

#### Working with copy numbers

In order to perform some statistical analysis of microsatellite models,
we need a function to convert the output of msprime into something that
we can work with easily. The variation data is returned using the
tskit {meth}`tskit.TreeSequence.variants` method, which uses an array of
alleles (the different states observed at a site) and an array of
"genotypes", which are the observations at that site for all of the samples.
Usually, we think of alleles as being nucleotides or amino acids which
are represented as strings. In this case, however, the alleles
represent copy-numbers which are still represented as strings. So,
to get the observed copy numbers, we must convert the alleles
to a numeric type, and obtain the actual observations by
indexing into this array. This is done in the following function:

```{code-cell} python
def copy_number_matrix(ts):
    """
    Returns the copy number matrix from the specified tree sequence
    simulated under a MicrosatMutationModel.
    """
    C = np.zeros((ts.num_sites, ts.num_samples), dtype=int)
    for var in ts.variants():
        alleles = np.array([int(allele) for allele in var.alleles])
        C[var.site.id] = alleles[var.genotypes]
    return C
```

Using this new tool, we can now look at the dependence of the variance in repeat
number on mutation rate under the {class}`.SMM` model. Much has been
written over the years on how to estimate the mutation
rate from the variance in repeat number
(e.g., [Zhivotovsky and Feldman, 1995](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8524801/)),
so let's simulate that signal:

```{code-cell} python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

rates = np.linspace(1e-2, 1e-4, num=20)
variances = []
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(100, random_seed=2, sequence_length=1, population_size=100_000)
for r in rates:
    mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=r, model=msprime.SMM(), random_seed=1)
    C = copy_number_matrix(mts)
    variances.append(C.var())

plt.plot(rates, variances)
plt.xlabel('Mutation rate')
plt.ylabel('Variance in repeat number');
```

So here we are seeing a clear relationship between the variance
in repeat number and mutation rate, as expected. 🔥🔥🔥

#### A more complicated microsatellite model

In the 1990s a lot of work went in to describing patterns of
mutation at microsatellite loci, and several models were
put forward describing various biases in expansion vs contraction,
mutistep mutations, and mutation rate biases. The 
{class}`.MicrosatMutationModel` implements the general parameterization 
of microsatellite mutation models developed in 
[Sainudiin et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.103.022665),
allowing users fine grained control of microsatellite mutation.

One concrete instance of this general model is the equal rate, linear biased, two-phase
mutation model of [Garza et al. (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a040239)
that we have implemented in {class}`.EL2`. Let's simulate large
samples under this model with different strengths of linear bias, 
and compare the distribution of allele sizes we get back.

```{code-cell} python
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from scipy import stats

biases = np.logspace(-7, 1, num=9)
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(
    1000, random_seed=2, sequence_length=1, population_size=100_000)
for v in biases:
    # these are values of m and u from Sainudiin et al. (2004)
    model = msprime.EL2(m=0.01, u=0.68, v=v)
    mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=1e-3, model=model)
    C = copy_number_matrix(mts)
    kde = stats.gaussian_kde(C.flatten())
    x = np.linspace(2, 51)
    plt.plot(x, kde(x), label=f'v={v}')
plt.xlabel('copy number')
plt.ylabel('frequency')
plt.legend()
plt.show();
```
From these simulations we can see that the linear bias parameter `v`
has a strong effect on the distribution of allele frequencies we
might expect from our model. Care should be taken when choosing
parameters for your own simulations. Potentially appropriate
values for dinucleotide repeats in humans and chimp could be taken
from Table 2 of [Sainudiin et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.103.022665), 
but we offer no guarantees and your mileage may vary. 

(sec_mutations_mutation_infinite_alleles)=
### Infinite Alleles Mutation Models

You can also use a model of *infinite alleles* mutation: where each new mutation produces a unique,
never-before-seen allele. The underlying mutation model just assigns the derived state
to be a new integer every time a new mutation appears.
By default these integers start at zero, but a different starting point can be chosen,
with the `start_allele` parameter.
It does this globally across all mutations, so that the first assigned allele will be `start_allele`,
and if `n` alleles are assigned in total (across ancestral and derived states),
these will be the next `n-1` integers.
Many theoretical results are derived based on this mutation model (e.g., Ewens' sampling formula).

For instance, here we'll simulate with the infinite alleles model on a single tree,
and print the resulting tree, labeling each mutation with its derived state:

```{code-cell} python

ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(6, random_seed=2, sequence_length=1)
model = msprime.InfiniteAlleles()
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=2, random_seed=1, model=model)
t = mts.first()
ml = {m.id: m.derived_state for m in mts.mutations()}
SVG(t.draw_svg(mutation_labels=ml, node_labels={}, size=(400, 300)))

```

Apparently, there were 20 mutations at this site, but the alleles present in the population are
"13" (in five copies), "17" (in two copies), and one copy each of "14", "15", "19", and "20".
Note that all other mutations on the tree are not observed in the population as they have
been are "overwritten" by subsequent mutations.

:::{warning}

Neither this nor the next infinite alleles mutation model check to see if the alleles
they produce already exist at the mutated sites. So, if you are using these
models to add mutations to an already-mutated tree sequence, it is up to you
to set the starting allele appropriately, and to make sure the results make sense!

### SLiM mutations

A special class of infinite alleles model is provided for use with [SLiM](<https://messerlab.org/slim/>),
to agree with the underlying mutation model in SLiM.
As with the InfiniteAlleles model, it assigns each new mutation a unique integer,
by keeping track of the `next_id` and incrementing it each time a new mutation appears.

This differs from the {class}`.InfiniteAlleles` because mutations
in SLiM can "stack": new mutations can add to the existing state, rather than
replacing the previous state. So, derived states are comma-separated lists of
mutation IDs, and the ancestral state is always the empty string. For instance,
if a new mutation with ID 5 occurs at a site, and then later another mutation
appears with ID 64, the sequence of alleles moving along this line of descent
would be `""`, then `"5"`, and finally `"5,64"`. Furthermore, the mutation
model adds SLiM metadata to each mutation, which records, among other things,
the SLiM mutation type of each mutation, and the selection coefficient (which
is always 0.0, since adding mutations in this way only makes sense if they are
neutral). For this reason, the model has one required parameter: the `type`
of the mutation, a nonnegative integer. If, for instance, you specify
`type=1`, then the mutations in SLiM will be of type `m1`. For more
information, and for how to modify the metadata (e.g., changing the selection
coefficients), see
[the pyslim documentation](<https://pyslim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>).
For instance,

```{code-cell} python

model = msprime.SLiMMutationModel(type=1)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(
    ts, rate=1, random_seed=1, model=model)
t = mts.first()
ml = {m.id: m.derived_state for m in mts.mutations()}
SVG(t.draw_svg(mutation_labels=ml, node_labels={}, size=(400, 300)))

```

These resulting alleles show how derived states are built.

The behaviour of this mutation model when used to add mutations to a previously mutated
tree sequence can be subtle. Let's look at a simple example.
Here, we first lay down mutations of type 1, starting from ID 0:

```{code-cell} python

model_1 = msprime.SLiMMutationModel(type=1)
mts_1 = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.5, random_seed=2, model=model_1)
t = mts_1.first()
ml = {m.id: m.derived_state for m in mts_1.mutations()}
SVG(t.draw_svg(mutation_labels=ml, node_labels={}, size=(400, 300)))

```

Next, we lay down mutations of type 2.
These we assign starting from ID 100,
to make it easy to see which are which:
in general just need to make sure that we start at an ID greater than any
previously assigned.

```{code-cell} python

model_2 = msprime.SLiMMutationModel(type=2, next_id=100)
mts = msprime.sim_mutations(
    mts_1, rate=0.5, random_seed=3, model=model_2, keep=True)
t = mts.first()
ml = {m.id: m.derived_state for m in mts.mutations()}
SVG(t.draw_svg(mutation_labels=ml, node_labels={}, size=(400, 300)))

```

Note what has happened here: on the top branch on the right side of the tree,
with the first model we added two mutations: first a mutation with ID `0`,
then a mutation with ID `3`.
Then, with the second model, we added two more mutations to this same branch,
with IDs `100` and `102`, between these two mutations.
These were added to mutation `0`, obtaining alleles `0,100` and `0,100,102`.
But then, moving down the branch, we come upon the mutation with ID `3`.
This was already present in the tree sequence, so its derived state is not modified:
`0,3`. We can rationalise this, post-hoc, by saying that the type 1 mutation `3`
has "erased" the type 2 mutations `100` and `102`.
If you want a different arrangement,
you can go back and edit the derived states (and metadata) as you like.
