# Legacy (version 0.x) APIs

Msprime 1.0 involved major changes to the internal details of
how simulations are performed and the addition of a new set of
APIs, which solve some long-standing issues and provide
more sensible defaults.

**Short version:**

- Your old simulations will still work and the msprime 0.x APIs will
be supported **indefinitely**. We're not going to break your code.
The only situation in which your simulation might break is if you've
been doing some obscure things with genome discretisation. Please
see {ref}`this section<sec_legacy_0x_genome_discretisation>` for
more information.

- The new APIs are **much better**, and support several features
that are not available for the legacy API. In general, new features
will only be added to the 1.x APIs and 0.x legacy APIs are
in **maintenance mode**.

## Upgrading code

This section is to help legacy 0.x users of msprime get up to speed quickly, summarising
the new APIs and their main differences to the 0.x versions.

The main change is that there are two new functions, {func}`.sim_ancestry` and
{func}`.sim_mutations` which correspond to the 0.x functions {func}`.simulate`
and {func}`.mutate`. The 0.x functions are **deprecated** but **will continue
to be supported indefinitely**.

One major change is that {ref}`ancestry<sec_ancestry>` and
{ref}`mutations<sec_mutations>` must be simulated **separately**.
A good pattern for this when performing
{ref}`replicate simulations<sec_ancestry_replication>` is

```{code-cell}
import msprime

ancestry_replicates = msprime.sim_ancestry(10, num_replicates=10)
for ts in ancestry_replicates:
    ts = msprime.sim_mutations(ts, rate=0.1)
    # Do something with your mutated tree sequence now.
```

This approach is memory efficient and uses high-quality random seeds.

### Ancestry

The new {func}`.sim_ancestry` function replaces the 0.x {func}`.simulate`
function and is very similar. See the {ref}`sec_ancestry` page for
details and extensive examples using this function.

There are some important differences between {func}`.simulate`
and {func}`.sim_ancestry`:

* The `samples` parameter now refers to the **number of individuals**
  rather than **the number of nodes** (i.e. monoploid genomes).
  Because the default {ref}`ploidy <sec_ancestry_ploidy>`
  is 2 (see the next point) the upshot is that `sim_ancestry(2)` will
  result in a tree sequence with *four* sample nodes, not two. (It is
  possible to override this behaviour using the list of {class}`.SampleSet`
  objects parameter to `samples`.)
* The `Ne` parameter in  0.x {func}`.simulate` function has been replaced
  with the `population_size` parameter.
* There is now a {ref}`sec_ancestry_ploidy` parameter, which has
  two effects:

  1. Sets the default number of sample nodes per *individual*
  2. Changes the {ref}`timescale<sec_ancestry_ploidy_coalescent_time_scales>`
     over which coalescence occurs.  By default `ploidy` is 2 and
     so mean time to common ancestor in a population of size `N` is `2N` generations,
     which is the same as msprime 0.x.
* Rather than two parameters `num_samples` and `samples`, the
  {func}`.sim_ancestry` function has a single parameter `samples` which
  has different behaviour depending on the type of parameters provided.
  See {ref}`sec_ancestry_samples` for details.
  Note in particular that a list of `Sample` objects is **not** supported.
* Similarly, there is now one parameter `recombination_rate` which can
  be either a single value or a {class}`.RateMap` object. Note that the
  0.x {class}`.RecombinationMap` is deprecated and not supported as input
  to {func}`.sim_ancestry`. See {ref}`sec_ancestry_recombination` for more
  details.
* Simulations are peformed on a **discrete** genome by default. To get the
  0.x behaviour of a continuous genome, set `discrete_genome=False`.
  See the {ref}`sec_ancestry_discrete_genome` section for more details.
* The `from_ts` parameter used has been renamed to `initial_state` and
  accepts either a {class}`tskit.TableCollection` or {class}`tskit.TreeSequence`
  parameter. See the {ref}`sec_ancestry_initial_state` section for details.
* There is **no** `mutation_rate` parameter to {func}`.sim_ancestry`: use
  {func}`.sim_mutations` instead.
* The `population_configurations`, `migration_matrix` and `demographic_events`
  parameters have been replace with a single parameter `demography`, which must take
  a {class}`.Demography` instance. (See the next section for more details.)

### Demography

A new {class}`.Demography` object has been added for version 1.0 which
encapsulates the functionality needed to define and debug demographic models
in msprime. Demographic models can only be specified to `sim_ancestry`
using an instance of this class.

See the {ref}`sec_demography` section for detailed documentation on this
new interface.

* It is easy to create a {class}`.Demography` from the 0.x
`population_configurations`, `migration_matrix` and `demographic_events`
values using the {meth}`.Demography.from_old_style` method.

* The {class}`.DemographyDebugger` class should no longer be instantiated
directly; instead use the {meth}`.Demography.debug` method.

### Genome discretisation

In msprime 0.x, recombination was implemented internally using a discrete
number of genetic loci. That is, the simulation was performed in
*genetic* coordinates, which were then mapped back to *physical* coordinates
at the end of simulation. This had the significant advantage that
recombination could be implemented during the simulation as a uniform process
over these discrete loci. However, it led to
a number of different numerical issues encountered when mapping back and
forth between genetic and physical coordinates as well as limiting
what could be done in terms of gene converion and other processes.
We therefore changed to using physical coordinates throughout the simulation
for msprime 1.0.

The simulations in 0.x and 1.x are almost entirely compatible and everything
should work as expected when running 0.x code on msprime 1.0 or later. However,
there is one (hopefully obscure) case in which code written for msprime 0.x
will no longer work.

The ``num_loci`` argument to the 0.x class {class}`.RecombinationMap`
was used to control the number of discrete genetic loci in the simulation. By
default, this was set to a large number ({math}`\sim 2^{32}`), effectively
giving a continuous coordinate space when mapped back into physical units.
By setting the ``num_loci`` equal
to the sequence length of the RecombinationMap, we could also specify
discrete physical loci. Specifying whether we simulate in discrete or continuous
genome coordinates is now done using the ``discrete_genome`` argument
to {func}`.sim_ancestry` (see the {ref}`sec_ancestry_discrete_genome`
section for more details). The {class}`.RateMap` class is now used to
specify varying rates of recombination along the genome and no longer
has any concept of genetic "loci" --- the choice of coordinate space
is now decoupled from our specification of the recombination process.

Both the cases of discrete and fully continuous genomes are well
supported in msprime 1.x  and so nearly all existing code
should continue to work as expected.
What is no longer supported is specifying the "granularity" of the
continuous space via the ``num_loci`` parameter, and if we try
to set ``num_loci`` to anything other than the sequence length
we get an error:

```{code-cell}
:tags: [raises-exception]
import msprime

# Here we try to make a sequence length of 10 with 5 discrete loci
recomb_map = msprime.RecombinationMap(positions=[0, 10], rates=[0.1, 0], num_loci=5)
```

If you get this error, please check whether specifying a
number of loci like this was actually what you intended. Almost
certainly you actually wanted to simulate a continuous genome
(omit the ``num_loci`` parameter) or a discrete genome
with the breaks occurring integer boundaries (set ``num_loci``
equal to the sequence length).

If not, please let us know your use case and we may be able
to accommodate it in the new code. Until then, you will need
to downgrade msprime to 0.7.x for your simulations to run.

### Mutations

Msprime 1.0 provides powerful new methods for simulating mutational
processes, adding support for finite-sites mutations and a
range of different {ref}`mutation models<sec_mutations_models>`.
Similarly to the approach for ancestry simulations, we introduce
a new function {func}`.sim_mutations` which allows us to provide
new, more appropriate defaults while still supporting older code.

Differences between the 1.x {func}`.sim_mutations` and 0.x {func}`.mutate`
functions:

* The {func}`.sim_mutations` function works on a **discrete** genome by default.

* There are now also many new mutation models supported by {func}`.sim_mutations`;
  see {ref}`sec_mutations` for details. These are *not* supported in the deprecated
  {func}`.mutate` function.

* The simulated mutations now have a simulated ``time`` value, which specifies the
  precise time that the mutation occurred. Note that this value is also provided in the
  returned tables for the deprecated ``simulate()`` and ``mutate()`` functions,
  which may lead to some compatibility issues. (We considered removing the simulated
  mutation times for these 0.x functions for strict compatibility, but this would
  have broken any code using the ``keep`` option in mutate.)
