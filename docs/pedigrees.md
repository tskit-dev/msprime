# Pedigrees

Pedigrees describe parent-offspring relationships between individuals,
and can be provided as input to constrain simulations of genetic ancestry
(see the {ref}`sec_ancestry_models_fixed_pedigree` section for details).
In this section we describe the data structures used to encode pedigrees
in msprime, and the utilities used to create input pedigrees.

(sec_pedigrees_encoding)=

## Pedigree encoding

Msprime uses the tskit
{ref}`node<tskit:sec_node_table_definition>` and
{ref}`individual<tskit:sec_individual_table_definition>` tables to encode pedigree
information.
Each {ref}`individual<sec_data_model_definitions_individual>`
is defined by a row in the individual table, and
this row index is the individual's **id**. Pedigree relationships
are defined using the ``parents`` column, which contains the IDs
of an individual's parents. Further information is stored in the
{ref}`nodes<sec_data_model_definitions_node>` associated with the individual.

:::{note}
It is important to note that sample status, time, and population information
is associated with an individual's nodes (see the {ref}`sec_ancestry_ploidy`
section for details), which is an artefact of tskit's node-centric design.
:::

It is possible to specify a pedigree model directly using tskit APIs,
but it is simpler to use the {class}`.PedigreeBuilder` utility
class (or the simplified text {ref}`sec_pedigrees_file_format`).
In the following example we build a simple trio:

```{code-cell}
pb = msprime.PedigreeBuilder()
mom_id  = pb.add_individual(time=1)
dad_id  = pb.add_individual(time=1)
pb.add_individual(time=0, parents=[mom_id, dad_id], is_sample=True)
pedigree = pb.finalise()
# TODO replace with display(pedigree) when its implemented in tskit
# https://github.com/tskit-dev/tskit/issues/2093
print(pedigree)
```

The pedigree returned by the {meth}`~.PedigreeBuilder.finalise` method
contains the pedigree information defined by the calls to
{meth}`~.PedigreeBuilder.add_individual`. For this trio, we began by adding
the parents, and because they are founders, we don't provide any information
about their parents. Each call to {meth}`~.PedigreeBuilder.add_individual`
returns the integer ID of newly added individual.

### Requirements



(sec_pedigrees_file_format)=

## Simplified file format

The methods described in {ref}`sec_pedigrees_encoding` are general and
allow for arbitrary metadata to be associated with individuals. It
is often convenient to work with a text based representation of
the pedigree, which is supported by the {func}`.parse_pedigree`.

### Basic structure

```{code-cell}
txt = """\
# id parent0 parent1 time
child mom dad 0
mom NA NA 1
dad NA NA 1
"""
pedigree = msprime.parse_pedigree(io.StringIO(txt))
display(pedigree.individuals)
display(pedigree.nodes)
```


(sec_pedigrees_visualisation)=

## Visualising pedigrees

```{code-cell}
import io
txt = """\
# id parent0 parent1 time
child mom dad 0
mom NA NA 1
dad NA NA 1
"""
pedigree = msprime.parse_pedigree(io.StringIO(txt))
display(pedigree.individuals)

display(pedigree.nodes)
```

```{code-cell}
pedigree.sequence_length = 100
ts = msprime.sim_ancestry(initial_state=pedigree, model="fixed_pedigree",
    random_seed=1)

SVG(ts.draw_svg())
```

## Visualising pedigrees

```{code-cell}
def draw_pedigree(ped_ts):
    G = nx.DiGraph()
    for ind in ped_ts.individuals():
        time = ped_ts.node(ind.nodes[0]).time
        G.add_node(ind.id, time=time)
        for p in ind.parents:
            if p != tskit.NULL:
                G.add_edge(ind.id, p)
    pos = nx.multipartite_layout(G, subset_key="time", align="horizontal")
    nx.draw_networkx(G, pos, with_labels=True)

tables = msprime.pedigrees.sim_pedigree(
    population_size=20, end_time=3, num_samples=5, direction="backward", random_seed=1)
tables.individuals
tables.sequence_length = 1

draw_pedigree(tables.tree_sequence())
```
