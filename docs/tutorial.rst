Tutorial
========

This is the tutorial for the Python interface to the ``msprime``
library. Detailed :ref:`sec_api` is also available for this
library. An :program:`ms` compatible :ref:`command line interface <sec_cli>`
is also available if you wish to use ``msprime`` directly within
an existing work flow.


****************
Simulating trees
****************

Running simulations is very straightforward in ``msprime``::


    >>> import msprime
    >>> tree_sequence = msprime.simulate(sample_size=5, Ne=1000)
    >>> tree = tree_sequence.first()
    >>> print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))
        8
     ┏━━┻━┓
     ┃    7
     ┃  ┏━┻┓
     6  ┃  ┃
    ┏┻┓ ┃  ┃
    ┃ ┃ ┃  5
    ┃ ┃ ┃ ┏┻┓
    2 3 4 0 1

Here, we simulate the coalescent for a sample of size
5 with an effective population size of 1000,
and then print out a depiction of the resulting tree.
The :func:`.simulate` function returns a
:class:`.TreeSequence` object, which provides a very
efficient way to access the correlated trees in simulations
involving recombination. In this example we know that
there can only be one tree because we have not provided
a value for ``recombination_rate``, and it
defaults to zero. Therefore, we access the only tree in the
sequence using the call ``tree_sequence.first()``. Finally,
we draw a simple depiction of the tree to the terminal
using the :meth:`~.SparseTree.draw` method.

Trees are represented within ``msprime`` in a slightly unusual way. In
the majority of libraries dealing with trees, each node is
represented as an object in memory and the relationship
between nodes as pointers between these objects. In ``msprime``,
however, nodes are *integers*.
In the tree above, we can see that the leaves of the tree
are labelled with 0 to 4, and all the internal nodes of the tree
are also integers with the root of the tree being 8.

We can easily trace our path
back to the root for a particular sample using the
:meth:`~.SparseTree.parent` method::

    >>> u = 0
    >>> while u != msprime.NULL_NODE:
    >>>     print("node {}: time = {}".format(u, tree.time(u)))
    >>>     u = tree.parent(u)
    node 0: time = 0.0
    node 5: time = 93.8536165443679
    node 7: time = 770.0314897144547
    node 8: time = 1950.6090018042169


In this code chunk we iterate up the tree starting at node 0 and
stop when we get to the root. We know that a node is a root
if its parent is :const:`msprime.NULL_NODE`, which is a special
reserved node. (The value of the null node is -1, but we recommend
using the symbolic constant to make code more readable.) We also use
the :meth:`~.SparseTree.time` method to get the time
for each node, which corresponds to the time in generations
at which the coalescence event happened during the simulation.
We can also obtain the length of a branch joining a node to
its parent using the :meth:`~.SparseTree.branch_length`
method::

    >>> print(tree.branch_length(5))
    676.1778731700867

The branch length for node 5 is about 676 generations as the time for
node 5 is 94 and the time of its parent is around 770 generation. It is also
often useful to obtain the total branch length of the tree, i.e.,
the sum of the lengths of all branches::

    >>> print(tree.total_branch_length)
    4926.506226955324

*************
Recombination
*************

Simulating the history of a single locus is a very useful, but we are most
often interesting in simulating the history of our sample across large genomic
regions under the influence of recombination. The ``msprime`` API is
specifically designed to make this common requirement both easy and efficient.
To model genomic sequences under the influence of recombination we have
two parameters to the :func:`.simulate()` function.
The ``length`` parameter specifies the length of the simulated sequence
in bases, and may be a floating point number. If ``length`` is not
supplied, it is assumed to be 1. The ``recombination_rate``
parameter specifies the rate of crossing over per base per generation,
and is zero by default. See the :ref:`sec_api` for a discussion of the precise
recombination model used.

Here, we simulate the trees across over a 10kb region with a recombination
rate of :math:`2 \times 10^{-8}` per base per generation, with an
effective population size of 1000::

    >>> tree_sequence = msprime.simulate(
    ...     sample_size=5, Ne=1000, length=1e4, recombination_rate=2e-8)
    >>> for tree in tree_sequence.trees():
    ...     print("-" * 20)
    ...     print("tree {}: interval = {}".format(tree.index, tree.interval))
    ...     print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))
    --------------------
    tree 0: interval = (0.0, 6016.224463474058)
        9
     ┏━━┻━┓
     ┃    8
     ┃  ┏━┻┓
     7  ┃  ┃
    ┏┻┓ ┃  ┃
    ┃ ┃ ┃  6
    ┃ ┃ ┃ ┏┻┓
    1 2 0 3 4

    --------------------
    tree 1: interval = (6016.224463474058, 10000.0)
         9
      ┏━━┻━━┓
      8     ┃
    ┏━┻━┓   ┃
    ┃   6   ┃
    ┃ ┏━┻┓  ┃
    ┃ ┃  5  ┃
    ┃ ┃ ┏┻┓ ┃
    0 4 1 3 2

In this example, we use the :meth:`~.TreeSequence.trees`
method to iterate over the trees in the sequence. For each tree
we print out its index (i.e., it's position in the sequence) and
the interval the tree covers (i.e., the genomic
coordinates which all share precisely this tree) using the
:attr:`~.SparseTree.index` and :attr:`~.SparseTree.interval` attributes.
Thus, the first tree covers the
first 6kb of sequence and the second tree covers the remaining 4kb.
We can see
that these trees share a great deal of their structure, but that there are
also important differences between the trees.

.. warning:: Do not store the values returned from the
    :meth:`~.TreeSequence.trees` iterator in a list and operate
    on them afterwards! For efficiency reasons ``msprime`` uses the same
    instance of :class:`.SparseTree` for each tree in the sequence
    and updates the internal state for each new tree. Therefore, if you store
    the trees returned from the iterator in a list, they will all refer
    to the same tree.


*********
Mutations
*********

Mutations are generated in ``msprime`` by throwing mutations down
on the branches of trees at a particular rate. The mutations are
generated under the infinite sites model, and so each mutation
occurs at a unique (floating point) point position along the
genomic interval occupied by a tree. The mutation rate for simulations
is specified using the ``mutation_rate`` parameter of
:func:`.simulate`. For example, the following chunk simulates 50kb
of nonrecombining sequence with a mutation rate of :math:`2 \times 10^{-8}`
per base per generation::

    >>> tree_sequence = msprime.simulate(
    ...    sample_size=5, Ne=1000, length=50e3, mutation_rate=2e-8, random_seed=30)
    >>> tree = tree_sequence.first()
    >>> for site in tree.sites():
    ...     for mutation in site.mutations:
    ...         print("Mutation @ position {:.2f} over node {}".format(
    ...             site.position, mutation.node))
    Mutation @ position 1179.94 over node 0
    Mutation @ position 4485.17 over node 5
    Mutation @ position 9788.56 over node 5
    Mutation @ position 11949.32 over node 7
    Mutation @ position 31454.99 over node 7
    Mutation @ position 34832.55 over node 0
    Mutation @ position 36747.63 over node 7
    Mutation @ position 46692.51 over node 5
    >>> print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))
        8

     5  ┃ ┃ ┃
    ┏┻┓ ┃ ┃ ┃
    0 3 1 2 4

********
Variants
********

We are often interesting in accessing the sequence data that results from
simulations directly. The most efficient way to do this is by using
the :meth:`.TreeSequence.variants` method, which returns an iterator
over all the :class:`.Variant` objects arising from the trees and mutations.
Each variant contains a reference to the site object, as well as the
alleles and the observed sequences for each sample in the ``genotypes``
field::

    >>> tree_sequence = msprime.simulate(
    ...     sample_size=20, Ne=1e4, length=5e3, recombination_rate=2e-8,
    ...     mutation_rate=2e-8, random_seed=10)
    >>> for variant in tree_sequence.variants():
    ...     print(
    ...         variant.site.id, variant.site.position,
    ...         variant.alleles, variant.genotypes, sep="\t")
    0       2432.768327416852       ('0', '1')      [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
    1       2577.6939414924095      ('0', '1')      [1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]
    2       2844.682702049562       ('0', '1')      [0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    3       4784.266628557816       ('0', '1')      [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0]

In this example we simulate some data and then print out the observed
sequences. We loop through each variant and print out the observed state of
each sample as an array of zeros and ones, along with the index and position
of the corresponding mutation.  In this example, the
alleles are always ``'0'`` (the ancestral state) and ``'1'``
(the derived state), because we are simulating simple infinite sites mutations. More
complex models are possible, however.

This way of working with the sequence data is quite efficient because we
do not need to keep the entire genotype matrix in memory at once. However, if
we do want the full genotype matrix it is simple to obtain::

    >>> A = tree_sequence.genotype_matrix()
    >>> A
    array([[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
           [1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1],
           [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
           [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]], dtype=uint8)

In this example, we run the same simulation but this time
store entire variant matrix in a two-dimensional numpy array.
This is useful for integrating with tools such as
`scikit allel <https://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

******************
Historical samples
******************

Simulating coalescent histories in which some of the samples are not
from the present time is straightforward in ``msprime``.
By using the ``samples`` argument to :meth:`msprime.simulate`
we can specify the location and time at which all samples are made.

.. code-block:: python

    def historical_samples_example():
        samples = [
            msprime.Sample(population=0, time=0),
            msprime.Sample(0, 0),  # Or, we can use positional arguments.
            msprime.Sample(0, 1.0)
        ]
        tree_seq = msprime.simulate(samples=samples)
        tree = tree_seq.first()
        for u in tree.nodes():
            print(u, tree.parent(u), tree.time(u), sep="\t")
        print(tree.draw(format="unicode"))

In this example we create three samples, two taken at the present time
and one taken 1.0 generations in the past. There are a number of
different ways in which we can describe the samples using the
``msprime.Sample`` object (samples can be provided as plain tuples also
if more convenient). Running this example, we get::


	>>> historical_samples_example()
	4       -1      1.3805592647990812
	1       4       0.0
	3       4       1.052473878566028
	0       3       0.0
	2       3       1.0
	  4
	┏━┻┓
	┃  3
	┃ ┏┻┓
	┃ ┃ 2
	┃ ┃
	1 0


Because nodes ``0`` and ``1`` were sampled at time 0, their times in the tree
are both 0. Node ``2`` was sampled at time 1.0, and so its time is recorded
as 1.0 in the tree.

***********
Replication
***********

A common task for coalescent simulations is to check the accuracy of analytical
approximations to statistics of interest. To do this, we require many independent
replicates of a given simulation. ``msprime`` provides a simple and efficient
API for replication: by providing the ``num_replicates`` argument to the
:func:`.simulate` function, we can iterate over the replicates
in a straightforward manner. Here is an example where we compare the
analytical results for the number of segregating sites with simulations:

.. code-block:: python

    import msprime
    import numpy as np

    def segregating_sites_example(n, theta, num_replicates):
        S = np.zeros(num_replicates)
        replicates = msprime.simulate(
			Ne=0.5,
            sample_size=n,
            mutation_rate=theta / 2,
            num_replicates=num_replicates)
        for j, tree_sequence in enumerate(replicates):
            S[j] = tree_sequence.num_sites
        # Now, calculate the analytical predictions
        S_mean_a = np.sum(1 / np.arange(1, n)) * theta
        S_var_a = (
            theta * np.sum(1 / np.arange(1, n)) +
            theta**2 * np.sum(1 / np.arange(1, n)**2))
        print("              mean              variance")
        print("Observed      {}\t\t{}".format(np.mean(S), np.var(S)))
        print("Analytical    {:.5f}\t\t{:.5f}".format(S_mean_a, S_var_a))

Running this code, we get::

	>>> segregating_sites_example(10, 5, 100000)
		      mean              variance
	Observed      14.17893          53.0746740551
	Analytical    14.14484          52.63903


Note that in this example we set :math:`N_e = 0.5` and
the mutation rate to :math:`\theta / 2` when calling :func:`.simulate`.
This is essential to convert the diploid per-generation time units
of msprime into the the haploid coalescent units required for many
theoretical results. However, it is important to note that conventions
vary widely, and great care is needed with such factor-of-two
rescalings.

********************
Population structure
********************

.. todo:: Update this example to use Ne=0.5 as recommended elsewhere.

Population structure in ``msprime`` closely follows the model used in the
``ms`` simulator: we have :math:`N` demes with an :math:`N\times N`
matrix describing the migration rates between these subpopulations. The
sample sizes, population sizes and growth rates of all demes
can be specified independently. Migration rates are specified using
a migration matrix. Unlike ``ms`` however, all times and rates are specified
in generations and all populations sizes are absolute (that is, not
multiples of :math:`N_e`).

In the following example, we calculate the mean coalescence time for
a pair of lineages sampled in different demes in a symmetric island
model, and compare this with the analytical expectation.

.. code-block:: python

    import msprime
    import numpy as np

    def migration_example(num_replicates=10**6):
        # M is the overall symmetric migration rate, and d is the number
        # of demes.
        M = 0.2
        d = 3
        m = M / (4 * (d - 1))
        # Allocate the initial sample. Because we are interested in the
        # between deme coalescence times, we choose one sample each
        # from the first two demes.
        population_configurations = [
            msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=1),
            msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=1),
            msprime.PopulationConfiguration(sample_size=0)]
        # Now we set up the migration matrix. Since this is a symmetric
        # island model, we have the same rate of migration between all
        # pairs of demes. Diagonal elements must be zero.
        migration_matrix = [
            [0, m, m],
            [m, 0, m],
            [m, m, 0]]
        # We pass these values to the simulate function, and ask it
        # to run the required number of replicates.
        replicates = msprime.simulate(
            population_configurations=population_configurations,
            migration_matrix=migration_matrix,
            num_replicates=num_replicates)
        # And then iterate over these replicates
        T = np.zeros(num_replicates)
        for i, tree_sequence in enumerate(replicates):
            tree = tree_sequence.first()
            T[i] = tree.time(tree.root) / 4
        # Finally, calculate the analytical expectation and print
        # out the results
        analytical = d / 2 + (d - 1) / (2 * M)
        print("Observed  =", np.mean(T))
        print("Predicted =", analytical)

Running this example we get::

    >>> migration_example()
    Observed  = 6.50638181614
    Predicted = 6.5

**********
Demography
**********

Msprime provides a flexible and simple way to model past demographic events
in arbitrary combinations. Here is an example describing the
`Gutenkunst et al. <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695>`_
out-of-Africa model. See
`Figure 2B <http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000695.g002>`_

Recombination maps
******************

The ``msprime`` API allows us to quickly and easily simulate data from an
arbitrary recombination map. In this example we read a recombination
map for human chromosome 22, and simulate a single replicate. After
the simulation is completed, we plot histograms of the recombination
rates and the simulated breakpoints. These show that density of
breakpoints follows the recombination rate closely.

.. code-block:: python

        recomb_map = msprime.RecombinationMap.read_hapmap(infile)

        # Now we get the positions and rates from the recombination
        # map and plot these using 500 bins.
        positions = np.array(recomb_map.get_positions()[1:])
        rates = np.array(recomb_map.get_rates()[1:])
        num_bins = 500
        v, bin_edges, _ = scipy.stats.binned_statistic(

Calculating LD
**************

The ``msprime`` API provides methods to efficiently calculate
population genetics statistics. For example, the :class:`.LdCalculator`
class allows us to compute pairwise `linkage disequilibrium
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linkage_disequilibrium>`_ coefficients.
Here we use the :meth:`.get_r2_matrix` method to easily make an
LD plot using `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_. (Thanks to
the excellent `scikit-allel
<http://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
for the basic `plotting code
<http://scikit-allel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/allel/stats/ld.html#plot_pairwise_ld>`_
used here.)

.. _sec_tutorial_threads:

********************
Working with threads
********************

When performing large calculations it's often useful to split the
work over multiple processes or threads. The msprime API can
be used without issues across multiple processes, and the Python
:mod:`multiprocessing` module often provides a very effective way to
work with many replicate simulations in parallel.

When we wish to work with a single very large dataset, however, threads can
offer better resource usage because of the shared memory space. The Python
:mod:`threading` library gives a very simple interface to lightweight CPU
threads and allows us to perform several CPU intensive tasks in parallel. The
``msprime`` API is designed to allow multiple threads to work in parallel when
CPU intensive tasks are being undertaken.

.. note:: In the CPython implementation the `Global Interpreter Lock
   <https://wiki.python.org/moin/GlobalInterpreterLock>`_ ensures that
   only one thread executes Python bytecode at one time. This means that
   Python code does not parallelise well across threads, but avoids a large
   number of nasty pitfalls associated with multiple threads updating
   data structures in parallel. Native C extensions like ``numpy`` and ``msprime``
   release the GIL while expensive tasks are being performed, therefore
   allowing these calculations to proceed in parallel.

In the following example we wish to find all mutations that are in approximate
LD (:math:`r^2 \geq 0.5`) with a given set of mutations. We parallelise this
by splitting the input array between a number of threads, and use the
:meth:`.LdCalculator.r2_array` method to compute the :math:`r^2` value
both up and downstream of each focal mutation, filter out those that
exceed our threshold, and store the results in a dictionary. We also
use the very cool `tqdm <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm>`_ module to give us a
progress bar on this computation.

.. code-block:: python

    import threading
    import numpy as np
    import tqdm
    import msprime

    def find_ld_sites(
            tree_sequence, focal_mutations, max_distance=1e6, r2_threshold=0.5,
            num_threads=8):
        results = {}
        progress_bar = tqdm.tqdm(total=len(focal_mutations))
        num_threads = min(num_threads, len(focal_mutations))

        def thread_worker(thread_index):
            ld_calc = msprime.LdCalculator(tree_sequence)
            chunk_size = int(math.ceil(len(focal_mutations) / num_threads))
            start = thread_index * chunk_size
            for focal_mutation in focal_mutations[start: start + chunk_size]:
                a = ld_calc.r2_array(
                    focal_mutation, max_distance=max_distance,
                    direction=msprime.REVERSE)
                rev_indexes = focal_mutation - np.nonzero(a >= r2_threshold)[0] - 1
                a = ld_calc.r2_array(
                    focal_mutation, max_distance=max_distance,
                    direction=msprime.FORWARD)
                fwd_indexes = focal_mutation + np.nonzero(a >= r2_threshold)[0] + 1
                indexes = np.concatenate((rev_indexes[::-1], fwd_indexes))
                results[focal_mutation] = indexes
                progress_bar.update()

        threads = [
            threading.Thread(target=thread_worker, args=(j,))
            for j in range(num_threads)]
        for t in threads:
            t.start()
        for t in threads:
            t.join()
        progress_bar.close()
        return results

    def threads_example():
        ts = msprime.simulate(
            sample_size=1000, Ne=1e4, length=1e7, recombination_rate=2e-8,
            mutation_rate=2e-8)
        counts = np.zeros(ts.num_sites)
        for tree in ts.trees():
            for site in tree.sites():
                assert len(site.mutations) == 1
                mutation = site.mutations[0]
                counts[site.id] = tree.get_num_samples(mutation.node)
        doubletons = np.nonzero(counts == 2)[0]
        results = find_ld_sites(ts, doubletons, num_threads=8)
        print(
            "Found LD sites for", len(results), "doubleton sites out of",
            ts.num_sites)

In this example, we first simulate 1000 samples of 10 megabases and find all
doubleton mutations in the resulting tree sequence. We then call the
``find_ld_sites()`` function to find all mutations that are within 1 megabase
of these doubletons and have an :math:`r^2` statistic of greater than 0.5.

The ``find_ld_sites()`` function performs these calculations in parallel using
8 threads. The real work is done in the nested ``thread_worker()`` function,
which is called once by each thread. In the thread worker, we first allocate an
instance of the :class:`.LdCalculator` class. (It is **critically important**
that each thread has its own instance of :class:`.LdCalculator`, as the threads
will not work efficiently otherwise.) After this, each thread works out the
slice of the input array that it is responsible for, and then iterates over
each focal mutation in turn. After the :math:`r^2` values have been calculated,
we then find the indexes of the mutations corresponding to values greater than
0.5 using :func:`numpy.nonzero`. Finally, the thread stores the resulting array
of mutation indexes in the ``results`` dictionary, and moves on to the next
focal mutation.


Running this example we get::

    >>> threads_example()
    100%|████████████████████████████████████████████████| 4045/4045 [00:09<00:00, 440.29it/s]
    Found LD sites for 4045 doubleton mutations out of 60100

**********************
Editing tree sequences
**********************

Sometimes we wish to make some minor modifications to a tree sequence that has
been generated by a simulation. However, tree sequence objects are **immutable**
and so we cannot edit a them in place. The answer is to use the
:ref:`sec_tables_api`: we export the tree sequence to a set of
:ref:`tables <sec_table_definitions>`, edit these tables, and then create
a new tree sequence from them. In the following example, we use this approach
to remove all singleton sites from a given tree sequence.

.. code::

    def strip_singletons(ts):
        sites = msprime.SiteTable()
        mutations = msprime.MutationTable()
        for tree in ts.trees():
            for site in tree.sites():
                assert len(site.mutations) == 1  # Only supports infinite sites muts.
                mut = site.mutations[0]
                if tree.num_samples(mut.node) > 1:
                    site_id = sites.add_row(
                        position=site.position,
                        ancestral_state=site.ancestral_state)
                    mutations.add_row(
                        site=site_id, node=mut.node, derived_state=mut.derived_state)
        tables = ts.dump_tables()
        new_ts = msprime.load_tables(
            nodes=tables.nodes, edges=tables.edges, sites=sites, mutations=mutations)
        return new_ts


This function takes a tree sequence containing some infinite sites mutations as
input, and returns a copy in which all singleton sites have been removed.
The approach is very simple: we allocate :class:`.SiteTable` and
:class:`.MutationTable` instances to hold the new sites and mutations that
we define, and then consider each site in turn. If the allele frequency of
the mutation is greater than one, we add the site and mutation to our
output tables using :meth:`.SiteTable.add_row` and :meth:`.MutationTable.add_row`.
(In this case we consider only simple infinite sites mutations,
where we cannot have back or recurrent mutations. These would require a slightly
more involved approach where we keep a map of mutation IDs so that
mutation ``parent`` values could be computed.)

After considering each site, we then create a new tree sequence using
:func:`.load_tables` using the node and edge tables from the original
tree sequence and the just-created site and mutation tables. Using
this function then, we get::

    >>> ts = msprime.simulate(10, mutation_rate=10)
    >>> ts.num_sites
    50
    >>> ts_new = strip_singletons(ts)
    >>> ts_new.num_sites
    44
    >>>

Thus, we have removed 6 singleton sites from the tree sequence.

.. todo::

    Add another example here where we use the array oriented API to edit
    the nodes and edges of a tree sequence. Perhaps decapitating would be a
    good example?

*******************
Working with Tables
*******************

.. todo::
    This section is a work in progress and needs to be revised.

Tables provide a convenient method for viewing, importing and exporting tree
sequences.  ``msprime`` provides direct access to the the columns of a table as
``numpy`` arrays: for instance, if ``n`` is a ``NodeTable``, then ``n.time``
will return an array containing the birth times of the individuals in the
table.  *However*, it is important to note that this is *not* a shallow copy:
modifying ``n.time`` will not change the node table ``n``.  This may change in
the future, but currently there are two ways to modify tables: ``.add_row()``
and ``.set_columns()`` (and also ``.clear()``, which empties the table).

The example node table above would be constructed using ``.add_row()`` as
follows::

    n = msprime.NodeTable()
    sv = [True, True, True, False, False, False, False]
    tv = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0]
    pv = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    for s, t, p in zip(sv, tv, pv):
        n.add_row(flags=s, population=p, time=t)

    print(n)

The ``.add_row()`` method is natural (and should be reasonably efficient) if
new records appear one-by-one. In the example above it would have been more
natural to use ``.set_columns()``::

    n = msprime.NodeTable()
    n.set_columns(flags=sv, population=pv, time=tv)


Finally, here is an example where we add 1.4 to every ``time`` except the first
in the NodeTable constructed above using ``numpy`` indexing::

    fn = n.flags
    pn = n.population
    tn = n.time
    tn[1:] = tn[1:] + 1.4
    n.set_columns(flags=fn, population=pn, time=tn)




Here is an example.  Consider the following sequence of trees::

    time
    ----
    1.0                6
    0.7               / \                                       5
                     /   x                                     / \
    0.5             /     4                 4                 /   4
                   /     / \               / x               /   / \
    0.4           /     /   \             /   3             /   /   \
                 /     /     \           /   / \           /   /     \
                /     /       \         /   /   x         /   /       \
               /     /         \       /   /     \       /   /         \
    0.0       0     1           2     1   0       2     0   1           2

    position 0.0                  0.2               0.8                1.0

First, we specify the nodes::

    NodeTable:

    id      is_sample    population   time
    0       1            0            0
    1       1            0            0
    2       1            0            0
    3       0            0            0.4
    4       0            0            0.5
    5       0            0            0.7
    6       0            0            1.0

Importantly, the first column, ``id``, is **not actually recorded**, and is
only shown when printing out node tables (as here) for convenience. This has
three samples: nodes 0, 1, and 2, and lists their birth times.  Then, we
specify the edges::

    EdgeTable:

    left    right   parent  children
    0.2     0.8     3       0
    0.2     0.8     3       2
    0.0     0.2     4       1
    0.0     0.2     4       2
    0.2     0.8     4       1
    0.2     0.8     4       3
    0.8     1.0     4       1
    0.8     1.0     4       2
    0.8     1.0     5       0
    0.8     1.0     5       4
    0.0     0.2     6       0
    0.0     0.2     6       4

Since node 3 is most recent, the edge that says that nodes 0 and 2 inherit
from node 3 on the interval between 0.2 and 0.8 comes first.  Next are the
edges from node 4: there are three of these, for each of the three genomic
intervals over which node 4 is ancestor to a distinct set of nodes.  At this
point, we know the full tree on the middle interval.  Finally, edges
specifying the common ancestor of 0 and 4 on the remaining intervals (parents 6
and 5 respectively) allow us to construct all trees across the entire interval.


In the depiction above, ``x`` denotes mutations. Suppose that the first
mutation occurs at position 0.1 and the mutations in the second tree both
occurred at the same position, at 0.5 (with a back mutation).  The positions
are recorded in the sites table::

    SiteTable:

    id	position	ancestral_state
    0	0.1     	0
    1	0.5     	0

As with node tables, the ``id`` column is **not** actually recorded, but is
implied by the position in the table.  The acutal mutations are then recorded::

    MutationTable:

    site	node	derived_state
    0	    4	    1
    1	    3	    1
    1	    2	    0

This would then result in the following (two-locus) haplotypes for the three
samples::

    sample  haplotype
    ------  ---------
    0       01
    1       10
    2       11

.. In addition to genealogical relationships, ``msprime`` generates and stores
.. mutations.  Associating these with nodes means that a variant shared by many
.. individuals need only be stored once, allowing retrieval and processing of
.. variant information much more efficiently than if every individual's genotype
.. was stored directly.


.. Rather than storing a position on the genome directly, a ``mutation``
.. stores the index of a ``site``, that describes that position.  This is to
.. allow efficient processing of multiple mutations at the same genomic
.. position.  A ``site`` records a position on the genome where a mutation has
.. occurred along with the ancestral state (i.e., the state at the root of the
.. tree at that position)::

..     id	position	ancestral_state
..     0	0.1	        0

.. As with nodes, the ``id`` is not stored directly, but is implied by its
.. index in the site table.


.. This type records a mutation that has occurred at some point in the
.. genealogical history.  Each mutation is associated with a particular
.. ``node`` (i.e., a particular ancestor), so that any sample which inherits
.. from that node will also inherit that mutation, unless another mutation
.. intervenes.  The type records::

..     site	node	derived_state
..     0	    14	    1

.. Here ``site`` is the index of the ``site`` at which the mutation occurred,
.. ``node`` records the ID of the ancestral node associated with the mutation,
.. and ``derived_state`` is the allele that any sample inheriting from that
.. node at this site will have if another mutation does not intervene.  The
.. ``node`` is not necessarily the ancestor in whom the mutation occurred, but
.. rather the ancestor at the bottom of the branch in the tree at that site on
.. which the mutation occurred.
