``msprime`` is a population genetics simulator
based on [tskit](https://tskit.dev). Msprime can simulate random
ancestral histories for a sample of individuals
(consistent with a given demographic model) under a
range of different models and evolutionary processes. Msprime can
also simulate mutations on a given ancestral
history (which can be produced by msprime or other programs
supporting [tskit](https://tskit.dev)) under
a variety of genome sequence evolution models.

Please see the [documentation](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/latest/) for
more details, including
[installation instructions](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/latest/installation.html).
