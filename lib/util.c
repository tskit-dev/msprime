/* The `fast_search_t` structure and functions
 *
 * `fast_search_t` is a lookup table pointing to an array of `double`s
 * (the "elements"). It does not own the array but does point to all its memory.
 *
 * Its purpose is to speed up the search for a "query" value in that array of
 * elements. The `fast_search_idx_strict_upper` function is essentially a drop-in
 * replacement for the function `idx_1st_strict_upper_bound` (which in turn is
 * a drop-in replacement for the C++ <algorithm> library function
 * std::upper_bound).
 *
 * The key concept behind `fast_search_t` is that the bits inside a
 * "query" `double` contain a good deal of information about where near-by
 * values in the array of elements might be found in memory. The best
 * performance is when the array of elements have values that increase roughly
 * linearly. But this is not a requirement. The only requirement is that the
 * elements be non-decreasing.
 *
 * Since the element values are not perfectly linear some re-mapping is
 * required.  This is achieved through an lookup array of element indexes.
 * Although there need not be a linear mapping between element values and the
 * range of query values, the lookup values (element indexes) are linear with
 * the range of query values.
 *
 * The `query_multiplier` determines the linear mapping between possible query
 * values and indexes in the lookup array of element indexes. Because the
 * `query_multiplier` is a power of 2, a predictable range of possible "query"
 * values will truncate to a specific lookup index.
 *
 * The size of the lookup array could be adjustable, but this simple
 * implementation chooses one simple strategy for the size of the lookup array.
 * For a perfectly linear sequence of element values, the lookup array will be
 * a simple progression of element indexes.
 * The extremely simple case of element values being the non-negative integers
 * is coded in the `test_fast_search_identity` unit test.
 * An example of alternative linear sequences with different `query_multiplier`
 * are coded in `test_fast_search_2powers`.
 *
 * Consider example target array of elements:
 *
 * (element index, element value)
 * [0], 0.0
 * [1], 0.1
 * [2], 0.8
 * [3], 2.7
 * [4], 6.4
 * [5], ___ (the end, past last element of the array)
 *
 * The power of 2 greater or equal to the maximum element is 8.
 * The number of memory address steps to the maximum element is 4.
 * The power of 2 greater or equal to that number of steps is also 4.
 * Thus the query multiplier is going to be 0.5.
 * The lookup table is going to start with an element index to the last of the elements.
 * The last element index in the lookup table will point to the end of the element array.
 * The lookup table should be just the right size so that rescaling (and truncating) a
 * query equaling the maximum element will result in an index to the last element index
 * in the lookup table. This is `trunc(6.4 * 0.5) = 3`. Thus the lookup table
 * will be `(1 + 1 + 3) = 5` element indexes.
 *
 * The lookup table of element indexes will handle the following 5 query ranges:
 *
 * [0.0, 2.0)
 * [2.0, 4.0)
 * [4.0, 6.0)
 * [6.0, 8.0)
 * [8.0, INFINITY)
 *
 * with each lookup entry pointing to the first upper bound to the minimum in those
 * query ranges. Thus we get the following lookup table of element indexes:
 *
 * (lookup index, element index)
 * [0] 0 (0.0 in elements is upper bound to query range minimum 0.0)
 * [1] 3 (2.7 in elements is upper bound to query range minimum 2.0)
 * [2] 4 (6.4 in elements is upper bound to query range minimum 4.0)
 * [4] 4 (6.4 in elements is upper bound to query range minimum 6.0)
 * [5] 5 (no upper bound in elements to query range minimum 8.0)
 *
 * Consider the search with a query of `3.3`. This query will be multiplied by
 * the query multiplier of 0.5 and then truncated to get lookup index `1`. This
 * corresponds the query range [2.0, 4.0) and all queries in that range when
 * multiplied by the query multiplier and truncated will result in lookup index
 * `1`. This entry in the lookup table maps to 0xECE3 which contains the value
 * 2.7. The next entry in the lookup table corresponds to the query range [4.0, 6.0)
 * and has 0xECE4 pointing to element value 6.4. Thus a much smaller binary
 * search will be performed on the memory range [0xECE3, 0xECE4) which will
 * result in finding 0xECE4 as the first strict upper bound to the query of `3.3`.
